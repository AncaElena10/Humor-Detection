A man goes to a bar every night at 5:30... He sits down and orders 3 beers. One day, the bartender asks, "Hey man, what's with the 3 beers? Why not just order one glass?" The man says, "My brothers and I made an agreement that wherever we are in the world, at 5:30 every night, we'll 'share a beer,' to remind each other of our bond. 1 for each of us." The bartender is touched and gives them to him for free. One day, the bartender notices that the man only orders 2 and assuming that one of the brothers passed away, offers his condolences, to which the man laughs and says, "Nobody died, I just gave up beer. I'm on a diet."

JOKE OF THE DAY The pro football team had just finished their daily practice session when a large turkey came strutting onto the field. While the players gazed in amazement, the turkey walked up to the head coach and demanded a tryout. Everyone stared in silence as the turkey caught pass after pass and ran right through the defensive line. When the turkey returned to the sidelines, the coach shouted, "You're terrific!!! Sign up for the season, and I'll see to it that you get a huge bonus." "Forget the bonus," the turkey said, "All I want to know is, does the season go past Thanksgiving Day?" --- http://www.bizfriend.org

Sweet Tea A doctor walks in an exam room to find a woman crying. She has two black eyes, her make up is running, and generally looks like shit. This is not going to be a standard check-up, he thinks to himself. "What happened to you?" asked the Doc. The woman breaks down even further and can barely speak between sobbing. "It's my husband. I just can't take it anymore. I love him, but I can't put up with this much longer," she says. "I'd do anything to make it stop." The Doc closes his eyes and asks, "What happens exactly?" "Everything is fine until the weekend. That's when the problems start. He goes out drinking with his buddies and plays cards, which he's horrible at." The Doc nods his head for her to continue. "He always comes home drunk and pissed off. Without fail, I end up getting beat." He thinks for a moment and asks, "You'd do anything to make it better?" "Yes, anything!" "I want you to go home and make a pitcher of sweet tea." The Doc holds up his hand to stop the inevitable questions and continues. "When your husband comes home from his night of drinking, I want you to pour yourself a glass of tea. Take the biggest mouthful you can and hold it there until your husband goes to sleep. Do this and I promise you the beatings will stop." The woman has doubt in her eyes, but is at the end of her rope. She'll try anything once at this point. Several weeks go by and the Doc walks into an exam room to see the same woman. She looks a thousand times better, has a smile on her face, and best of all no signs of recent abuse. "Doc, it worked! I did everything you asked." She's obviously excited. "I made that sweet tea and poured myself a glass. When my husband came home drunk after a bad night of cards, I took the biggest mouthful of tea I could. I held it there until he went to sleep." The Doc can see tears of happiness forming in the woman's eyes. "I think you've save my sanity and my marriage, thank you." The Doc looks the woman in the eyes, "See what happens when you keep your fucking mouth shut?"

Twenty enemy ships on the horizon!" And the captain turns to his cabin boy and says "Bring me my brown pants!"

Gotta Pee... Two women friends had gone for a girl's night out. Both were very faithful and loving wives, but they had gotten over-enthusiastic on the Bacardi Breezers. Incredibly drunk and walking home they needed to pee, so they stopped in the cemetery. One of them had nothing to wipe with so she thought she would take off her panties and use them. Her friend however was wearing a rather expensive pair of panties and did not want to ruin them. She was lucky enough to squat down next to a grave that had a wreath with a ribbon on it, so she proceeded to wipe with that. After the girls did their business, they proceeded to go home. The next day one of the women's husbands was concerned that his normally sweet and innocent wife was still in bed hung over, so he phoned the other husband and said, 'These girl nights out have got to stop! I'm starting to suspect the worst... My wife came home with no panties!!' 'That's nothing,' said the other husband, 'Mine came back with a card stuck to her ass that said.....'From all of us at the Fire Station. We'll never forget you!

Joke of the Day! The pro football team had just finished their daily practice session when a large turkey came strutting onto the field. While the players gazed in amazement, the turkey walked up to the head coach and demanded a tryout. Everyone stared in silence as the turkey caught pass after pass and ran right through the defensive line. When the turkey returned to the sidelines, the coach shouted, "You're terrific!!! Sign up for the season, and I'll see to it that you get a huge bonus." "Forget the bonus," the turkey said, "All I want to know is, does the season go past Thanksgiving Day?"

In the market for a new car... Renault and Ford have joined forces to create the perfect small car for women. Mixing the Renault 'Clio' and the Ford 'Taurus' they have designed the 'Clitaurus'. It comes in pink, and the average male car thief won't be able to find it - let alone turn it on - even if someone tells him where it is and how to do it. Rumor has it though, that it leaks transmission fluid once a month, and can be a real bitch to start in the morning! Some have reported that on cold winter mornings you can't get it to turn over. New models are initially fun to own, but very costly to maintain, and horribly expensive to get rid of. Used models may initially appear to have curb appeal and a low price, but eventually have an increased appetite for fuel, and the curb weight typically increases with age. Manufacturers are baffled as to how the size of the trunk increases. This model is not expected to reach collector status. Most owners find it is best to lease one, and replace it each year.
Making a horse laugh...and cry A man goes into a bar and racks up a substantial tab that he cannot pay for. The bartender tells him that if he can make a horse laugh, his drinks will be free, but it's never been done before. So the bartender watches as the man finds a horse and whispers in his ear, and to his surprise, the horse busts up laughing. About a year later, the same man goes to the bar and is once again offered free drinks, but this time only if he can make the horse cry. Sure enough, the bartender once again sees the horse and the man together, this time with tears running down the horse's face. The bartender says to the man, "ok, I gotta ask, how did you make the horse laugh last year?" He answers, "I told him my dick was bigger than his." "Well, ok then, but how did you make him cry?" The man answered, "I showed him."
SFW Joke my Granddad used to tell, i was the only one who ever found it funny A guy gets sent to prison. His first day in the yard they are told to walk in a circle, no talking allowed between the prisoners. After a few minutes somebody yells "16" and the whole yard errupts with laughter. They continue walking in circles when someone else shouts out "54" and again everybody starts dying laughing. The new guy, being confused, whispers to the guy in front, "Hey whats with the numbers?" The other prisoner tells him , "well since we arent allowed to speak to one another we've memorized jokes and assigned numbers to them all. When somebody shouts out a number, we think of the joke and then laugh". Wanting to make a good impression on his first day, the new guy waits his turn. More numbers are called and everyone is laughing as they walk. Finally the new guy decides to make his mark, "18" he yells....but nobody laughs. After a few minutes he whispers to the guy in front again, "Hey what the hell man?" The guy turns to him and says, "ahh well its all in the way you tell it". Thanks for listening Reddit. RIP Grandad

Finest Bat Once upon a time Dracula decided to carry some sort of a competition to see which is the finest bat to stand on his side. So all the bats were honored to take part. The rules were simple. Whichever bat drinks more blood, will be the winner! So the first bat goes and comes back after 10 minutes. Her mouth was full of blood. Dracula says, "Congratulations, how did you do that?" The bat said, "Do you see that tower? Behind it there is a house. I went in and sucked the blood of all the family." "Very good" said Dracula. The second bat goes and comes back after 5 minutes all her face covered in blood. Astonished Dracula says, "How did you do that?" The bat replies, "Do you see that tower? Behind it there is a school. I went in and drunk the blood of all the children." "Impressive" said Dracula. Now the third bat goes and comes back after three minutes literally covered in blood from top to toe. Dracula is stunned. "How on earth did you do that????" he asked. And the bat replies, "Do you see this tower?" Dracula replies with a yes. And the bat says, "Well, I didn't."

One night after some wildlife attacked and he defended her succesfully, getting a few cuts in the process, she threw herself at him and they made love, after that, they where for all intents and purposes a couple with an above regular sex life. But for some reason he started drifting away, something was bothering him. And she noticed... "Whats wrong?" Scarlett Johansson asked, "Nothing..." the guy would say... She pestered him for a while eventually saying she would do ANYTHING he needed or wanted to make him feel good again, just because she really cared for him a lot, and even if he wasnt asking, she felt it was the least she owed it to him... - "Really?, youll do anything id like?" - "yes" she said "anything!" - "ok, first i want you to take off you toga and get into this pair of work jeans that somehow washed on the shore" - "ok..." - "now put this shirt on please, but first, "tape" your boobs so they are flat" - "wha... ok, id say id do anything" she said lovingly. - "ok, now, take this hat and wear it, but tuck your hair under it" she was kinda confused, but non the less, she wanted to make him happy, so she tuck her hair under the hat. - "Now id like for you to grab this piece of soot and paint yourself a beard and a mustache" - "ok... if this is what you want..." she muttered. - "now, please, put on these sunglasses, and start walking down the beach ill catch up to you in a bit" he said a bit excited...

A rancher dies and leaves everything to his wife She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand. Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching. For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, "You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels." The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return. Two o'clock and no hired hand. Finally he returned a round two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him. She quietly called him over to her.. "Unbutton my blouse and take it off," she said. Trembling, he did as she directed. "Now take off my boots." He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. "Now take off my socks." He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. "Now take off my skirt." He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. "Now take off my bra.." Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor. Then she looked at him and said, "If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired."

Voodoo Dick There was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man said, "Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except.... and he stopped. "Except what?" the man asked. "Nothing, nothing." "C'mon, tell me! I need something!" "Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick.'" "So what's up with this voodoo dick?" he asked. The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said "Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!" The old man replied, "But you haven't seen what it'll do yet." He pointed to a door and said "Voodoo dick, the door." The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said "Voodoo dick, get back in your box!" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there quiescent once more. "I'll take it!" said the businessman. The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say "Voodoo dick, my pussy." He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone. After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said "Voodoo dick, my pussy!" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing. The officer looked at her for a second, and then said "Yeah, right.. Voodoo dick, my ass!"

Nelson Mandela... Nelson Mandela is sitting at home watching TV and drinking a beer when he hears a knock at the door. When he opens it, he is confronted by a Japanese man, clutching a clipboard and yelling, "You Sign! You sign!" Behind him is an enormous truck full of car exhausts. Nelson is standing there in complete amazement, when the Japanese man starts to yell louder: "You sign! You sign!" Nelson says to him, "Look, you've obviously got the wrong man", and shuts the door. The next day he hears a knock at the door again. When he opens it, the Japanese is back with a huge truck of brake pads. He thrusts his clipboard under Nelson's nose, yelling, "You sign! You sign!" Mr. Mandela is getting a bit hacked off by now, so he pushes the Japanese man back, shouting: "Look, go away! You've got the wrong man! I don't want them!" Then he slams the door in his face again. The following day, Nelson is resting, and late in the afternoon, he hears a knock on the door again. On opening it, there is the same Japanese thrusting a clipboard under his nose, shouting, "You sign! You sign!" Behind him are TWO very large trucks full of car parts. This time Nelson loses his temper completely, he picks up the man by his shirt and yells at him; "Look, I don't want these! Do you understand? You must have the wrong name! Who do you want to give these to? The little Japanese man looks at him very puzzled, consults his clipboard and says... "You not Nissan Main Dealer?"

"The watch" My dad just reminded me of this old classic! Jake is struggling through a bus station with two huge and obviously heavy suitcases when a stranger walks up to him and asks "Have you got the time?" Jake sighs, puts down the suitcases and glances at his wrist. "It's a quarter to six," he says. "Hey, that's a pretty fancy watch!" exclaims the stranger. Jake brightens a little. "Yeah, it's not bad. Check this out" - and he shows him a time zone display not just for every time zone in the world, but for the 86 largest metropolitan areas. He hits a few buttons and from somewhere on the watch a voice says "The time is eleven 'til six" in a very West Texas accent. A few more buttons and the same voice said something in Japanese. Jake continues "I've put in regional accents for each city". The display is unbelievably high quality and the voice is simply astounding. The stranger is struck dumb with admiration. "That's not all," says Jake. He pushes a few more buttons and a tiny but very hi-resolution, map of New York City appears on the display. "The flashing dot shows our location by satellite positioning," explains Jake. "View recede ten," Jake says, and the display changes to show eastern New York state. "I want to buy this watch!" says the stranger. "Oh, no, it's not ready for sale yet; I'm still working out the bugs, says the inventor. "But look at this," and he proceeds to demonstrate that the watch is also a very creditable little FM radio receiver with a digital tuner, a sonar device that can measure distances up to 125 meters, a pager with thermal paper printout and, most impressive of all, the capacity for voice recordings of up to 300 standard-size books," though I only have 32 of my favorites in there so far" says Jake. "I've got to have this watch!" says the stranger. "No, you don't understand; it's not ready." "I'll give you $1000 for it!" "Oh, no, I've already spent more than -" "I'll give you $5000 for it!" "But it's just not -" "I'll give you $15,000 for it!" And the stranger pulls out a checkbook. Jake stops to think. He's only put about $8500 into materials and development, and with $15,000 he can make another one and have it ready for merchandising in only six months. The stranger frantically finishes writing the check and waves it in front of him. "Here it is, ready to hand to you right here and now. $15,000. Take it or leave it." Jake abruptly makes his decision. "OK," he says, and peels off the watch. They make the exchange and the stranger starts happily away. "Hey, wait a minute," calls Jake after the stranger, who turns around warily. Jake points to the two suitcases he'd been trying to wrestle through the bus station. "Don't forget your batteries.

A rancher and his family have a milk cow... A rancher and his family have a milk cow, and not much else to their name. The milk is the sweetest, toppest grade dairy around. One day, the rancher wakes up and finds his milk cow dead. Unable to face life with his sole source of income gone, he sets up a noose in the barn and takes his life. The rancher's wife wakes up that same day, and goes to find her husband. When she sees the cow dead, and her husband hanging beside it, she goes to the nearby river and drowns herself. The rancher's eldest son wakes up, finds the cow, his dad, and his mother all dead. He is approached by a beautiful woman who says that if he can make love to her 10 times in a row, that she will revive his parents and the cow. If he failed, she would kill him. The eldest son, of course eager, immediately agrees. He doesn't make it, and she kills him on the spot. The second eldest son wakes up, finds his family dead along with the cow, and is approached by this same mysterious beautiful woman, who proposes the same arrangement. This son, also eager, quickly jumps at the opportunity. Again, the son falls short and is killed. The third and youngest son wakes up and finds his family and cow dead, and is approached by the woman. "Rough day, huh?" She said, offering him the same deal as her brothers. "So I make love to you 10 times without stopping... and you bring everyone back... What if I make love to you 15 times?" "Well... I'll bring everyone back, even the cow, and put a mansion where your little ranch is." "Ok... well what if I make love to you 20 times without stopping?" Laughing, the mysterious woman says, "Well, I'll give you a great big bag of gold, jewels, and money. So much that you and your family will be set for life." "Fine, fine... but last question. If I make love to you 20 times without stopping, what's to stop you from dying from it? The milk cow did."

The Three Paddies Meet a Wizard Paddy Englishman, Paddy Scotsman and Paddy Irishman are walking in the woods when they stumble across an old sex wizard down on his luck. "Wishes for a tenner!" shouts the wizard. "I'll give you anything you like, but I'm sick and tired of making knobs bigger, so don't ask!" Without wasting a second, Paddy Englishman hands the wizard a ten pound note. "I want my wife to be ten times more adventurous in bed." The sex wizard nods. "Uxor non inhibitoris! An easy one! It is done!" Paddy Scotsman counts out nine pound coins and two 50 pence pieces. "My wife and I are happy enough, but I'm terrified of becoming a grandfather before I'm 50. I'd be obliged if you could fix it so my teenage daughters can't get pregnant before they're 25." The sex wizard nods. "Filiae non fertilismus! Very wise! It is done!" The sex wizard turns to Paddy Irishman, who has his hands planted firmly in his pockets and looks ready to move on. "No wish for you?" "I'll save my tenner," says Paddy Irishman, with a grin.

Johnny said, "Because I'm a Republican." The teacher asked him why he was a Republican. Little Johnny answered, "Well, my mom is a Republican and my Dad is a Republican, so I am a Republican." Annoyed by the answer, the teacher asked, "If your mom was a moron, and your dad was an idiot, what would that make you?" With a big smile, little Johnny replied, "That would make me an Obama fan."

Took a Cab Home With the Holidays upon us I would like to share a personal experience with all of you about drinking and driving. As you may know, some of us have been known to have brushes with the authorities from time to time on the way home after a "social session" out with friends. Well, two days ago I was out for an evening with friends and had several drinks of Scotch followed by some rather nice red wine... a dry Chianti I think it was. Feeling jolly, I still had the sense to know that I may be slightly over the limit. That's when I did something that I've never done before, I took a cab home. Sure enough on the way home there was a police road block, but since it was a cab they waved it past. I arrived home safely without incident. This was a real surprise as I had never driven a cab before, I don't know where I got it, and now that it's in my garage I'm not sure what to do with it.

There's this lady who works in a bank... ... her name is Patricia Wack, but all her friends and colleagues call her Pattie. She's very good at her job. One of those people who pays painful and pedantic attention to detail, does everything by the book, and is generally a bit annoying, but does a great job as a bank teller. One day, while she's going about her daily tasks, a frog hops up onto her counter. "I want a loan," says the frog. "Have you filled out the application?" asks Patricia. "No," replies the frog. "I don't need to bother with all that bullshit. Just go and get your manager. I've dealt with him before, and he'll give me the loan." "Hang on," says Patricia, "I don't see any paperwork or ID, and I don't know the first thing about you. I don't know if you're having me on, or trying to defraud the bank. What's your name?" "Kermit Jagger," says the frog. "Now you're really having me on," says Patricia. "Get out of this bank before I call the police." "No, seriously, go talk to your manager," says the frog. He digs around in his pocket and pulls out a Mr Bean Bobblehead. "Take this and give it to him. He'll know what it is." Patricia reluctantly takes the toy, and walks upstairs to her manager's office. She knocks on the door, and he waves her in. "What is it, Pattie?" He asks. "Well, sir, there's a frog downstairs wanting a loan, but has none of the necessary documents or ID. He says he knows you, and to give you this." With that she places the bobblehead on the manager's desk. The manager looks at it for a little while, smiles and says, "No worries, Pattie. You can go ahead and approve him up to $20,000." "But sir!!! He has no ID or credit history with him! He didn't bring any paperwork, and won't do this by the book at all! What's going on, anyway? And what is that... toy that he made me bring to you, anyway?? What's that got to do with it?" The manager sighs, leans forward, and says, "It's a nick-nack, Pattie Wack. Give the frog a loan. His old man's a Rolling Stone."

Bad Luck!!! A man who owned a local grocery store was out delivering orders in his station wagon when he hit and injured a little, old lady. The lady sued and was awarded an amount large enough to drive the man out of business. After difficult times he managed to accumulate enough to try again. But a few months after opening his doors he struck an old gentleman with his delivery truck. The gentleman sued and collected big damages, enough to ruin the merchant yet again. On a peaceful Sunday, the grocer was sitting in his living room when his little boy entered and called out, "Father, Father, Mother's been run over by a great big bus." The grocer's eyes filled with tears, and in a voice trembling with emotion he cried, "Thank the Lord, my luck's changed at last." [read more](http://jokessmsshayari.blogspot.com)

If World War One were a bar fight. Germany, Austria and Italy are standing together in the middle of a pub when Serbia bumps into Austria and spills Austria's pint. Austria demands Serbia buy it a complete new suit because there are splashes on its trouser leg. Germany expresses its support for Austria's point of view. Britain recommends that everyone calm down a bit. Serbia points out that it can't afford a whole suit, but offers to pay for the cleaning of Austria's trousers. Russia and Serbia look at Austria. Austria asks Serbia who it's looking at. Russia suggests that Austria should leave its little brother alone. Austria inquires as to whose army will assist Russia in compelling it to do so. Germany appeals to Britain that France has been looking at it, and that this is sufficiently out of order that Britain should not intervene. Britain replies that France can look at who it wants to, that Britain is looking at Germany too, and what is Germany going to do about it? Germany tells Russia to stop looking at Austria, or Germany will render Russia incapable of such action. Britain and France ask Germany whether it's looking at Belgium. Turkey and Germany go off into a corner and whisper. When they come back, Turkey makes a show of not looking at anyone. Germany rolls up its sleeves, looks at France, and punches Belgium. France and Britain punch Germany. Austria punches Russia. Germany punches Britain and France with one hand and Russia with the other. Russia throws a punch at Germany, but misses and nearly falls over. Japan calls over from the other side of the room that it's on Britain's side, but stays there. Italy surprises everyone by punching Austria. Australia punches Turkey, and gets punched back. There are no hard feelings because Britain made Australia do it. France gets thrown through a plate glass window, but gets back up and carries on fighting. Russia gets thrown through another one, gets knocked out, suffers brain damage, and wakes up with a complete personality change. Italy throws a punch at Austria and misses, but Austria falls over anyway. Italy raises both fists in the air and runs round the room chanting. America waits till Germany is about to fall over from sustained punching from Britain and France, then walks over and smashes it with a bar stool, then pretends it won the fight all by itself. By now all the chairs are broken and the big mirror over the bar is shattered. Britain, France and America agree that Germany threw the first punch, so the whole thing is Germany's fault . While Germany is still unconscious, they go through its pockets, steal its wallet, and buy drinks for all their friends.

The Pope's Coffee - From my grandfather Nescafe manages to arrange a meeting with the pope at the Vatican . After receiving the papal blessing, the Nescafe official whispers, "Your Eminence, we have an offer for you. Nescafe is prepared to donate $100 million to the church if you change the Lord's Prayer from 'give us this day our daily bread' to 'give us this day our daily coffee.'" The pope responds, "That is impossible. The prayer is the word of the Lord. It must not be changed." "Well," says the Nescafe man, "we anticipated your reluctance. For this reason we will increase our offer to $300 million." "My son, it is impossible. For the prayer is the word of the Lord, and it must not be changed." The Nescafe guy says, "Your Holiness, we at Nescafe respect your adherence to the faith, but we do have one final offer... We will donate $500 million - that's half a billion dollars - to the great Catholic Church if you would only change the Lord's Prayer from 'give us this day our daily bread' to 'give us this day our daily coffee.' Please consider it." And he leaves. The next day the Pope convenes the College of Cardinals. "There is some good news," he announces, "and some bad news. The good news is that the Church will come into $500 million." "And the bad news, your Holiness?" asks a Cardinal. "We're losing the Wonderbread account."

The Scottsman Well a Scotsman clad in kilt left a bar one evening fair And one could tell by how he walked the he'd drunk more than his share He fumbled 'round until he could no longer keep his feet And he stumbled off in to the grass to sleep beside the street About that time two young and lovely girls just happened by One says to the other, with a twinkle in her eye "See yon sleeping Scotsman, so strong a handsome built? I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt." They crept up on that sleeping Scotsman quiet as could be Lifted up his kilt about an inch so they could see And there, behold, for them to view beneath his Scotish skirt Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth They marveled for a moment, then one said "We must be gone. Let's leave a present for our friend before we move along" As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon tied in to a bow Around the bonnie star the Scot's kilt did lift and show Now the Scotsman woke to nature's call and stumbled towards the trees Behind the bush he lifts his kilt, and gawks at what he sees And in a startled voice he says, to what's before his eyes, "Lad, I don't know where ya been, but I see you've won first prize" The Irish Rovers, "The Scottsman"

The Three Construction Workers Three construction workers were at lunch one day, a Mexican, an Italian, and a Blonde man. While eating, the Mexican says "I love my wife, but if she makes me one more burrito for lunch, I swear I will jump off this building!" The Italian man joins in as well "I agree, my friend, I have been eating her pizza every day for 10 years! I will join you if my wife makes me this for lunch again!" Then the Blonde man pipes in, saying "Me too! I don't want another bologna sandwich, so count me in!" The next day, sure enough the Mexican man gets his burrito, the Italian his pizza and the Blonde a bologna sandwich. So they wrote a note, and in unison, keeping with their oath they hurl themselves off the top of the skyscraper! At the funeral, the wives of the Mexican man and the Italian man were both very sad, wishing they had known they could have prevented their deaths. But the blonde mans wife was upset like the others, so they asked her why she wasn't sad. She responded "Hey, don't look at me. He made his own lunch."

Two men died and were in line at the pearly gates Two men appeared at the pearly gates together. Seeing that there was a line to get in, they struck up a conversation. "How'd you die?" Said the first man to the second. "I suffocated and froze to death in a deep freeze. I wouldn't recommend it as a good way to go. You?" "Oh it was horrible," said the first. "I came home early from work and heard my wife having sex upstairs. I crept up the back staircase to catch them in the act, but they heard me and he took off down the main stairs. I ran the rest of the way up the stairs, then back down the front stairs, only to hear the basement door slam shut. Between running up and down the stairs and all the stress from the ordeal, I dropped dead of a heart attack in the living room." "That's horrible," says the second. "If you'd have made it to the basement and looked in the freezer I'd probably still be alive."
First-year med-students in their first anatomy class... It is the first day of medical school, and the doctor in charge of the new class has all the new students gather in the main lecture hall for the orientation. Taking his place in front of the group, he starts his speech. "In order to succeed in the world of medicine, you must first master two things" he says, scanning his eyes across the room. "The first: you must be completely comfortable with anything on, in, or around the human body" and with this utterance dramatically whips the sheet off of a cadaver that has been laid face down on the table in front of him. He then, to the amazement of the medical students gathered in front of him proceeds to shove a finger into the cadavers anus, pulls the finger out, and then puts a finger into his mouth. "To impress upon you how important this is, I will now require that all of you form a line, walk up to the cadaver, and then do precisely as I have just done. Any person who find themselves unwilling to attempt this will automatically fail the program. If you don't think that you can handle it, the door is over there". After a minute of shocked murmuring, the students make their decision. A handful head to the door but the large majority of them form a line and proceed to mimic their instructor. After the students have finished and sat down, the doctor continues with his speech. "The second thing that you must master is this: pay attention to each and every detail, let none escape your notice. Needless to say, all of you have a great deal of work to do in this. I am appalled that not a single, solitary one of you noticed that I stuck my index finger into the cadaver's rectum, but my middle finger into my mouth".

Again the boy asks, "hey, do you think I can have a beer grandpa?" And again the grandfather replies "Well can you reach your asshole with the tip of your penis?" The boy has no other answer then "no". "Then you ain't old enough for a beer son" More later on, the boy pulls out a Snickers. The grandfather asks "hey boy, give me a piece of that snickers." Thia time the boy asks "well grandpa, can you reach your asshole with the tip of your penis?" "Son, you bet your ass I can" "Well then you can go fuck yourself."

There once was a big, strong bull... There once was this big, strong bull. Had a ring in his nose, big horns and he went by the name of Hannibal. He had a field to himself with green grass, small dandelions and a fence. One day, the farmer brings some pretty cute cows and puts them in the field next to Hannibal. So the bull walks up to the barbed wire and checks out the pretty ladies on the other side. He knows that he would like to get to know them a bit better - if you know what I mean - , but there is this fence between them. So he waits until the farmer leaves, takes a long run and jumps over the fence into the other field. The cows look all startled and giggle: "O my, Hannibal... how did you get in here?" He winks: "Just call me Hanni, honey... The rest I left hanging in the barbed wire." - Sorry for the English, it is not my first language.

We give them a spoon, a cup and a bucket; and then ask ask them to empty the bathtub... While I was being given a tour of a mental asylum, I asked the psychiatrist, "How do you establish whether or not a person should be committed to your institution?" The doctor answered, "We have a standard test. We fill up a bathtub with water, then give the person a spoon, a cup and a bucket, and ask him or her to empty the bathtub." "I see," I said. "A normal person would use the bucket because it's much bigger than the spoon or the cup." "No," said the doctor, "a normal person would pull the drain plug. Would you like a bed near the window?"
3 Guys go to hell... ...and are greeted by a charming looking gentleman at the gate. "Greetings," the man says "I'm Satan, welcome to hell!" to which the 3 men begin to back away in fear, but Satan approached them gently "Now now fellas, there's nothing to be scared of! I'm quite the reasonable guy! Come on I'll give you the tour!" Unsure, but curious, the 3 guys follow Satan around through various rooms. "And here we have Dave! Dave wished to have enough money to swim in!" and they peaked through a hole to see a man gleefully swimming through gold. "Now, you each get your own room!" and the men were ecstatic! The first man bursts forward "Oh, Oh me first!" and Satan nods "I want all of the most beautiful women!" and Satan smiles and leads him to a platinum door, opening it to reveal a warehouse sized room full of the most beautiful women of all races, and all naked, enticing him to enter. Satan stops the man from entering "One last thing, a simple 'catch' as you might say, you cannot leave the room for 1000 years. Are you sure this is your one true desire?" he asks, receiving a yes without hesitation. "Very well, the room is all yours!" the man gives Satan a hug and runs into the room with Satan closing, and locking the door behind him. The second man, a little pudgy man, steps forward and says "I love to eat, I want a room full of the best food from all around the world!" and Satan nods, and brings the man to a different room, which when opened revealed different varieties of cakes, pie, cooked entrees, and delicacies. His eyes light up, and he rushes on in with the door closing and locking behind him. Satan looks towards the third man who hesitantly asks Satan "Hey man, do you have a room with a lot of weed?

How to pick up women There was a guy who had terrible luck with women, but his best friend was a real Cassanova. He asks his friend the secret to picking up random women, and he says "When a woman walks by you on the sidewalk, say 'Tickle your ass with a feather?'" If the woman agrees to this she's yours, but if she gets offended and asks what you said, just say "Particularly nice weather?" So the guy sets out to try this new method and sees a pretty lady right away. But as she walks by, he gets flustered and forgets his line, and just blurts out "I'll use a feather to tickle your ass!" The woman says "Excuse me?" and the guy says "Hot ain't it?"

The mexican guy goes 1st and says: "I wish that my homeland is rid of all hardships so all my people in the USA can move peacefully back to Mexico." and poof! The wish is granted. The black guy goes next and says: "I wish that my homeland is rid of all hardships so all my people in the USA can move peacefully back to Africa." and poof! The wish is granted. Last up is the white guy, he asks the genie: "with their wishes, all the Mexicans and blacks are back to their home lands?" The genie replies: "yes, they all are." The white guy then says: "I'll have a coke please."
An Englishman is visiting Ireland for the first time... His first stop is Cork where he decides he wants to kiss the famous Blarney Stone. Unfortunately for him he hasn't a clue where the stone is, so he walks into a pub to ask for directions. He walks into the pub and yells, "Alright Paddies, I'm visiting from London and I'm looking for someone to take me to kiss this famous Blarney's Stone I've heard so much about." There's a small stir in the bar as every Irishman scowls at him, until one man stands up. The huge, red-bearded man walks over to the Englishman, towering over him by a full foot. He says, "Aye, I'll take ye to the Blarney Stone, but there's something you missed." "And what might that be?" the Englishman replies. "Ye see, there's two Blarney stones." the Irishman tells him. The Englishman, slightly peeved at this insight, sighs to him, "Well I don't care, I just want to kiss one." "Well alright," the Irishman replies as he drops his pants, "I'm Blarney. Kiss one."
An old Saint's joke A Cajun died and went to hell. The devil assigned him the usual punishment...put him in the mass pit where the heat was melting others. The devil came back sometime later, surprised to find the Cajun just sitting around, not even misting, much less sweating. "How come you're not so much as sweating here where everyone else is screaming for relief from the heat?" The Cajun laughed and said, "Man, I was raised in the bayous of Sout Looziana. Dis ain't nothin' but May in Morgan City to me!" The devil decided to really put the Cajun through it. He put him in a sealed off cave in the pit with open blazes and four extra furnaces blasting. When he came back, days later, the Cajun was sitting pretty, had barely begun to sweat. The devil was outraged.. "How is this possible!? You should be melted to a shrieking puddle in these conditions!." The Cajun laughed even harder than before. "Hey, man! I done tole you. I was raised in Sout Looziana. You tink dis is heat?! Dis ain't nothin' but August in Cow Island !" So the devil thought, 'Alright, a little reverse ought to do the trick.' He put the Cajun into a corner of hell where no heat ever reached. It was freezing, and to add to the Cajun's misery, he added massive icebergs and blasting frozen air. When he returned, the Cajun was shivering, ice hung from every part of him, but he was grinning like it was Christmas. Exasperated, the devil asked "HOW!? How is it possible?! You're impervious to heat and here you sit in conditions you can't be used to...freezing cold, and yet you're happier than if you were in heaven. WHY?!" The Cajun kept grinning and asked, "Don't dis mean de Saints won da Super Bowl?"

The day of The Crucifixion comes. Jesus is having a really bad day. He suffers the accusations, the flaying, the denials, then gets marched out of town to spend the rest of the day on a plank of wood. He's up there, pretty bummed out. Eventually, Peter comes before Jesus where he hangs, looks up to him and says, weeping. "....&lt;moan&gt;...oh..oh Lord. I'm so sorry. For everything, it's so...I m-mean, you were RIGHT! You were right about everything! You said you would be betrayed, you said I would deny you three times, you KNEW! I know now, you are my Lord, King of Kings. I just want to know, if there's anything I can do, anything at all, that would ease your suffering or help you in your last moments in this land." And Jesus, then, looked down upon the apostle Peter, and Said, "AAAAAAHHHHH! HARRGGGGNNOOAAAHHHHHH! AAAAAAAAAHHHH!"

Doctor's Consultation A patient returns to the doctors office for a consultation regarding his x-rays and biopsies. The Doctor says, "I've got some good news and some bad news.

Health Insurance A new medical intern was touring the hospital he would be working at, being shown around by the chief of medicine. Walking and talking down the hall they stop at one of the rooms and open the door. They see a man getting a hand job from a female nurse. "What's going on in there?" asked the intern. "Nothing to worry about, just routine treatment," replied the chief of medicine. They walk a bit more and come to a second room and the chief opens the door. This time, a male patient is getting a blow job. "Now hold on!" says the intern. "I have to know what the hell this patient has to warrant such treatment!" The chief turns to the intern and says, "This patient has the same condition as the first, just better health insurance."
So Ole and Sven go to hell... (from my local newspaper) Ole and Sven are from Minnesota. They die in a snowmobiling accident, drunker than skunks and go to Hell. The Devil observes that they are really enjoying themselves. He says to them 'Doesnt the heat and smoke bother you?' Ole replies, 'Vell, ya know, ve're from nordern Minnesota, da land of snow an ice, an ve're yust happy fer a chance ta varm up a little bit, ya know.' The devil decides that these two aren't miserable enough and turns up the heat even more. When he returns to the room of the two from Minnesota , the devil finds them in light jackets and hats, grilling Walleye and drinking beer. The devil is astonished and exclaims, 'Everyone down here is in misery, and you two seem to be enjoying yourselves?' Sven replies, 'Vell, ya know, ve don't git too much varm veather up dere at da Falls, so ve've yust got ta haff a fish fry vhen da veather's dis nice.' The devil is absolutely furious. He can hardly see straight. Finally he comes up with the answer. The two guys love the heat because they have been cold all their lives. The devil decides to turn all the heat off in Hell. The next morning, the temperature is 60 below zero, icicles are hanging everywhere, and people are shivering so bad that they are unable to wail, moan or gnash their teeth. The devil smiles and heads for the room with Ole and Sven. He gets there and finds them back in their parkas, bomber hats, and mittens. They are jumping up and down, cheering, yelling and screaming like mad men. The devil is dumbfounded, 'I don't understand, when I turn up the heat you're happy. Now its freezing cold and you're still happy. What is wrong with you two?' They both look at the devil in surprise and say, 'Vell, don't ya know, if hell is froze over, dat must mean da Vikings von da Super Bowl.' (Just a Minnesotan twist on a classic!)

A blind man goes on vacation. He's never been to Texas, and decides to check it out. He books his plane tickets, heads to the airport, and gets on the plane. When he sits in his seat, he's amazed to discover that the seat is much bigger than any airplane seat he's ever sat in. "Wow, this seat is gigantic!" he says. "I can practically curl up and fit my whole body on this chair!" The woman next to him says, "Sure, everything's bigger in Texas, hun." The blind man lands at Dallas/Ft. Worth and catches a taxi to his hotel. He wants to go out and experience the city, but since it's been a long day of travel, he decides to get a drink at the hotel bar first. He orders a beer, but instead of the pint he expects, the bartender hands him a mug that's practically the size of a bucket. "Damn," the blind man says, "this beer is huge!" The bartender says, "Oh yes sir, but you know everything's bigger in Texas." Well, after a couple of hours, the blind man finishes his beer and it's really gone straight to his bladder. He slurs to the bartender, "My good man, could you point me towards the restroom in this fine establishment?" The bartender says, "Sure, it's right down that hall, third door on your right." The blind man makes his way down the hall, but in his state of inebriation (it was a lot of beer!), he misses the third door and opens the fourth instead, which happens to be the hotel swimming pool. He slips and falls in and starts panicking and yelling "Don't flush, don't flush!"

The Magician and the Parrot... There's a magician and a parrot on a cruise ship as part of the nightly entertainment. Every night, the parrot ruins the magician's tricks by revealing to the audience how they were done. For example, if the magician correctly guesses the card a volunteer is holding, the parrot shouts: "They're all the same card! They're all the same card!" If the magician stunningly pulls a rabbit out of his hat, the parrot exclaims: "There's a trap door in the hat! There's a trap door in the hat!" One night, the cruise ship sinks. Luckily, the magician and the parrot are able to make their way onto a piece of floating debris. For the next three days, they say absolutely nothing to each other. Then, on the fourth day, the parrot looks the magician right in the eyes and says: "Alright, I give up. How the hell did you make the ship disappear?"

Spaghetti For years, a man was having an affair with an Italian woman. One night, she confided in him that she was pregnant. Not wanting to ruin his reputation or his marriage, he said he would pay her a large sum of money if she would go to Italy to secretly have the child. Furthermore, if she stayed in Italy to raise the child, he would also provide child support until the child turned 18. She agreed, but asked how he would know when the baby was born. To keep it discreet, he told her to simply mail him a post card, and write 'Spaghetti' on the back. He would then arrange for the child support payments to begin. One day, about 9 months later, he came home to his confused wife. 'Honey, she said, 'you received a very strange post card today.' 'Oh, just give it to me and I'll explain it later,' he said. The wife obeyed and watched as her husband read the card, turned white, and fainted. On the card was written: Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti. Three with meatballs, two without. Send extra sauce.

Can I see your vehicle registration papers?" "I'm sorry, I can't do that." The policeman says, "Why not?" "I stole this car." The officer says, "Stole it?" The man says, "Yes, and I killed the owner." At this point the officer is getting irate. "You what!?" "She's in the trunk if you want to see." The Officer looks at the man and slowly backs away to his car and calls for back up. Within minutes, five police cars show up, surrounding the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car with his gun drawn. The senior officer says "Sir, could you step out of your vehicle please!" The man steps out of his vehicle. "Is there a problem sir?" "One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner." "Murdered the owner?" The officer responds, "Yes, could you please open the boot of your car?" The man opens the trunk, revealing nothing but an empty trunk. The officer says, "Is this your car sir?" The man says "Yes," and hands over the registration papers. The officer, understandably, is quite stunned. "One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving licence." The man digs in his pocket revealing a wallet and hands it to the officer. The officer opens the wallet and examines the licence. He looks quite puzzled. "Thank you sir, one of my officers told me you didn't have a licence, stole this car, and murdered the owner." The man replies, "I'll bet he told you I was speeding, too!"

Once upon a time, there was a computer Once upon a time, there was a village idiot. He excelled at doing precisely what he was told to do. However, being an idiot, he never questioned his orders. His parents convinced the village blacksmith to apprentice the idiot. The blacksmith explains to the idiot, "Grab a rod with these tongs, and put it on the anvil, and I'll hit it with this hammer." The idiot puts the rod on the anvil OK, but it's at the wrong angle. The blacksmith realizes his instructions were a little vague on that point, and he tries giving clearer directions. But it's no use -- he can't explain it precisely enough for the idiot to hold the rod just right. So the blacksmith says, "Let's change jobs -- **I'll** position the rod and **you** hit it with the hammer." The instant the blacksmith touches the rod to the anvil, before even he has a chance to position it properly, the idiot starts hammering away at the rod. Frustrated, the blacksmith thinks to himself -- how can he phrase this so there's NO POSSIBLE WAY the idiot can screw up? Aha! The blacksmith says: "I am going to put the rod on the anvil -- **do not** hit it. When I nod my head, you hit it."

A long joke about a monastery and a strange noise. A travelling salesman is driving along a dusty backroad to his next sale, when his car starts belching smoke. He sees storm clouds coming his way and night is falling soon. Getting out of the car he looks around for shelter and sees an antiquated old monastery on a hill not 5 minutes walk away. He heads over and knocks on the door just as the rain starts falling and a kindly monk answers. "Hi, my car is broken down on the road" says the salesman, "and I see a storm coming in. Can I stay the night and call a tow truck in the morning? I won't be any trouble..." "not at all my good man" the kindly monk replied, "Come in! Come in! Lets get you a hot meal and some dry clothes!" So the salesman is ushered into the church and given a wonderful bowl of hearty stew and bread to eat. Not realizing his hunger before the salesman devours the food in between words of thanks. "I don't know how I can repay you people..." "well actually" said the kindly monk who answered the door, "our abbot bores so easily in the realitive solitude of our church, and he loves to talk with travelers" "of course!" replied the salesman, "in return for this hospitality its the least i could do" So the kindly monk leads the salesman deeper into the monastery and as he does he hears the faintest sound... thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... But the salesman thinks its just the storm outside making noise and pays it no mind. He reaches the abbots quarters and meets a man seemingly as ancient as the building he runs who greets him with a smile and firm handshake. The two speak to each other at length with hours seeming like minutes as the storm pounds the outside, and all the while the man hears that same noise... thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... Eventually the conversation draws to a natural end and the abbot looks over the salesman's shoulder. "good heavens, look at the time. we both should get some rest" the abbot commented, "the brother you met before will take you to your chambers for the night" And so the salesman is taken to his spartan looking accommodations, and just as the kindly monk is leaving the room the salesman asks, "by the way, i keep hearing this strange thumping sound all the time. Its that normal? What is that?" The monk looks down at his feet, and for the first time since the salesman came into the monastery the smile falls from his face. He quickly stares at the floor and stammers, "I-I-I don't know what you're talking about. Sleep well." Slamming the door behind him. The salesmans sleep is restless as now the same sound as before stays next to him, breathing on his neck.... thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... When dawn breaks the salesman calls a tow truck, and while waiting says his goodbyes and thank yous. Finally when the tow truck arrives he turns to the abbot and says, "thank you so much for everything again, but I must ask; what is that strange thudding noise I hear? The storm is over yet I heard it clearly all night?" The monk gains a sudden steel in his eyes and locks them dead onto the salesman. "I can't tell you, you're not a monk." And with that, bids him farewell. The salesman finishes his route without incident, and heads home to his wife and child. But incessantly, as if by hearing it he could no longer un-hear it, at the quietest moments in his life, the salesman hears a soft thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... The seasons pass into years and the years pass into decades. The mans son grows and leaves to be his own man, and after decades of bliss the mans wife passes away peacefully in his arms one morning. As the life leaves his loves eyes the only sound heard is a simple thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... With a life now emptier the thudding becomes constant, unceasing, droning. When he sleeps, eats, shits thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... Finally, standing it no longer the man drives all day and night to the same dirt road he so happened to break down upon and every mile, every town he passes as constant as the odometer thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... Finally he reaches the monastery and knocks on the door and just as before a fresh faced kinly monk answers. "I WISH TO JOIN YOUR ORDER" the man blurts before the monk can say anything. The monk gains a knowing smile and says no more, beckoning the man to follow him. He leads the man on the same path he took those years and years before and directs him into the abbots room. Inside is the same man as the night he stayed before, looking not a day older. "Please abbot." The man begged, "I can't stop hearing that thudding noise, night and day I can't escape it. Can't you let me know what it is?" The abbot replies with the same steely matter-of-fact tone as he did all those years before, "I can't tell you, you're not a monk." "Thats what I feared your answer would be. Please then, let me become a monk so I can learn and get this sound from my head." The abbot takes a long look, dripping with both hunger and pity and after a handful of breathes agrees." The training is arduous and lengthy. The salesman is not a young man anymore and the demands, moth mental and physical task him to the core of his very being. He sleeps on stone, reads nothing but the texts of the obscure religious sect he wishes to join and eats nothing but gruel and through every minute, every blister, every headache, every pang of hunger the sound is there. thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... Finally after several years worth of trails the man finally is ready to be inducted. The moment after the ceremony inducting him is complete he bolts to the chambers of the abbot. "There, I did it. I'm a member of the order. NOW TELL ME WHAT THAT NOISE IS." "Are you sure you wish to know?" the abbot grimaces, "It will change the way you think of not just the order, or me, but everything." "Yes!" the man cries "I've never been more sure of anything in my life!" "Very well" replied the abbot. And with that the sound in the mans head lessened, as if the promise curiosity being fed was able to sate the beast, even if for a moment. But still, even though quieter it was still present. thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... The abbot pulls a seemingly random book off the shelf behind him, and opens it. He reveals it to be hollow and pulls a monstrous set of keys from it and tucks them into his sleeve. He then pulls another book from the shelf and the shelf splits in half and opens like the doors in a supermarket with the sound of the grinding of ancient stone. Where the shelves used to be there is a door made of iron. The abbot pulls the set of keys out with an iron key extended, opens the door and swings it aside. As the man follows the abbot into the path behind the door he notices the sound getting louder. thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... They walk along a dark and musty path, the air like a forgotten wine cellar or crypt with the abbot wordlessly staring forward with grim purpose. He reaches the next door, a door made of polished bronze, reflecting as perfectly as a mirror. He pulls out a bronze key from the keyring in his sleeve and opens the door. Sure enough as the man passes though, a little louder this time thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... After the bronze door came a staircase, down and down and down it went, until it seemed that they were descending into hell itself. Winding stairs, spiral stairs, branching stairs leading to nowhere and yet the two marched on, reaching a silver door. The abbot pulled out a silver key and as before set the door aside, making the sound ever louder. thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... And then, it was time to climb. Yet the abbot, a man of innumerable years climbed as surefooted as a goat while the salesman followed behind, exhausted but determined not to give up now. At the apex of the climb, a door of gold was before them. The abbot then pulled a gold key, and in the grim routine as before, the door fell aside and the sound became ever louder. It seemed to be right next to them, a tangible force. A third person on this bizarre trek. thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... After the golden door came a maze. Dizzying and seemingly endless, the abbot had no hesitation in his step and never second guessed himself. Hours passed in the maze as hours had passed in all the paths before and yet without ever turning around the abbot and the salesman reached a platinum door. As you can guess, platinum key, door, noise. thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... As the man walked into the next door he hesitated for the first time on his trip. The walls themselves seemed to be alive, screaming things in alien tongues as if the brick and mortar where being tortured. Grotesque faces in the masonry screamed as if every injustice upon earth was being visited upon them and yet somehow they could not drown out that sound, pounding louder than it ever had. thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... After the hours that seemed of days in the pathway that screamed ceaselessly they reached a door, red and pulsing, as if made of some sort of flesh. The abbot pulled out a bony, fleshy....something from his keyring and inserted it into the door. All at once the walls stopped screaming, the flesh melted into nothing on the floor and the sound grew terrible and great. Louder and unchanged. thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... Behind the former wall of flesh was not another passage but a box. Wooden small and humble. The abbot pulled out one final key of wood and unlocked and opened the box. As he pulled the box open the sound became deafeningly loud and the man finally looked inside and gave a horrified scream. And I'd love to tell you what was inside, but you're not a monk.
Baseball &amp; Football -George Carlin Baseball is different from any other sport, very different. For instance, in most sports you score points or goals; in baseball you score runs. In most sports the ball, or object, is put in play by the offensive team; in baseball the defensive team puts the ball in play, and only the defense is allowed to touch the ball. In fact, in baseball if an offensive player touches the ball intentionally, he's out; sometimes unintentionally, he's out. Also: in football,basketball, soccer, volleyball, and all sports played with a ball, you score with the ball and in baseball the ball prevents you from scoring. In most sports the team is run by a coach; in baseball the team is run by a manager. And only in baseball does the manager or coach wear the same clothing the players do. If you'd ever seen John Madden in his Oakland Raiders uniform,you'd know the reason for this custom. Now, I've mentioned football. Baseball &amp; football are the two most popular spectator sports in this country. And as such, it seems they ought to be able to tell us something about ourselves and our values. I enjoy comparing baseball and football: Baseball is a nineteenth-century pastoral game. Football is a twentieth-century technological struggle. Baseball is played on a diamond, in a park.The baseball park! Football is played on a gridiron, in a stadium, sometimes called Soldier Field or War Memorial Stadium. Baseball begins in the spring, the season of new life. Football begins in the fall, when everything's dying. In football you wear a helmet. In baseball you wear a cap. Football is concerned with downs - what down is it? Baseball is concerned with ups - who's up? In football you receive a penalty. In baseball you make an error. In football the specialist comes in to kick. In baseball the specialist comes in to relieve somebody. Football has hitting, clipping, spearing, piling on, personal fouls, late hitting and unnecessary roughness. Baseball has the sacrifice. Football is played in any kind of weather: rain, snow, sleet, hail, fog... In baseball, if it rains, we don't go out to play. Baseball has the seventh inning stretch. Football has the two minute warning. Baseball has no time limit: we don't know when it's gonna end - might have extra innings. Football is rigidly timed, and it will end even if we've got to go to sudden death. In baseball, during the game, in the stands, there's kind of a picnic feeling; emotions may run high or low, but there's not too much unpleasantness. In football, during the game in the stands, you can be sure that at least twenty-seven times you're capable of taking the life of a fellow human being. And finally, the objectives of the two games are completely different: In football the object is for the quarterback, also known as the field general, to be on target with his aerial assault, riddling the defense by hitting his receivers with deadly accuracy in spite of the blitz, even if he has to use shotgun. With short bullet passes and long bombs, he marches his troops into enemy territory, balancing this aerial assault with a sustained ground attack that punches holes in the forward wall of the enemy's defensive line. In baseball the object is to go home! And to be safe! - I hope I'll be safe at home!

It's Christmas time at the Pearly Gates.. Three men died on Christmas Eve and were met by Saint Peter at the pearly gates. 'In honour of this holy season' Saint Peter said, 'You must each possess something that symbolizes Christmas to get into heaven.' The Englishman fumbled through his pockets and pulled out a lighter. He flicked it on. 'It's a candle', he said. 'You may pass through the pearly gates' Saint Peter said. The Scotsman reached into his pocket and pulled out a set of keys. He shook them and said, 'They're bells.' Saint Peter said 'You may pass through the pearly gates'. The Irishman started searching desperately through his pockets and finally pulled out a pair of women's panties. St. Peter looked at the man with a raised eyebrow and asked, 'And just what do those symbolize?' The paddy replied, 'These are Carols.'
Wanna hear my joke about pizza? Nevermind, it's too cheesey.
The army had to fire three of their generals.. They decided that a monetary compensation would be fitting, so they lined the three generals up and said: "You will be paid a thousand dollars for each centimeter of distance you create from one body part to another" The first general stretched his arms as far from each other as he possibly could, and said "Measure the distance from the fingertips on my left hand, to the fingertips on my right hand." they paid the general and went on to the next. The second general stretched his arms as far above his head as possible and said "Measure the distance from the tip of my fingers to the tip of my toes" he was paid, and left with even more money than the first general. They got to the final general, who promptly said "I want you to measure the distance from my left nut to my right nut" The soldier with the measuring tape didn't understand what was happening but did as he was told. A few moments later the confused soldier said "Sir, i don't understand. I can only see your right nut" The general said with a big smile on his face: "I know, i lost my left nut in 'nam"

Who says men don't remember? A couple were Christmas shopping. The shopping center was packed , and as the wife walked through one of the malls she was surprised when she looked around to find that her husband was nowhere to be seen. She was quite upset because they had a lot to do and so she became so worried that she called him on her mobile phone to ask him where he was. In a quiet voice he said, "Do you remember the jewelers we went into about five years ago where you fell in love with that diamond necklace that we couldn't afford, and I told you that I would get it for you one day?" The wife choked up and started to cry and said, "Yes, I do remember that shop." He replied, "Well, I'm in the pub next door."

Mrs. Smith had just walked in the front door and was setting her purse down when the phone rang. "Hello?" said Mrs. Smith. "Yes, Mrs. Smith, this is Mary calling from the hospital. I'm afraid I've got some bad news and some worse news about your husband." "Oh dear," said Mrs. Smith, "I guess I'll take the bad news first." "Well," said the nurse, "The bad news is that we got the test results back for your husband but there's been a bit of a mix-up. It seems that there's another patient at the hospital with the same name as your husband, Bob, and we're not sure which test result belong to which patient. One of the tests came back positive for Alzheimer's disease and the other test came back positive for AIDS." "Oh my goodness," said Mrs. Smith, "Well that's horrible. What news could be worse than that?" "The worse news is that we can't find your husband. He left his room and we're not sure where he went," said the nurse. "Oh my god!" exclaimed Mrs. Smith, "What do you suggest we do?" "Well," replied the nurse, "if your husband finds his way home, don't have sex with him."

A guy walks into a bar... and takes a seat next to a huge jar filled with 5 and 10 dollar bills. The guy asks the bartender what the money is for. The bartender tells the man that he has three tasks and if he does them all he gets the money. The guy asks what the first task is and the bartender pulls out a bottle of Tabasco sauce and tells the man that he must drink the entire bottle and keep a straight face. The guy says fuck it and orders a drink instead. After a while and the man has had a couple of drinks he goes up to the bartender and tells him to give him the Tabasco bottle. The guy drinks the bottle, keeps a straight face, and slams the bottle on the counter. "What are the next two tasks?" the man asks already slurring his words. The Bartender replies "the second is you have to go out in the back and pull the bad tooth out of my rottweiler, then you have to go upstairs a fuck my 80 year old grandmother."

Four nuns were out for a stroll one day... ...when a bus lost control and plowed into them, killing them all instantly. When they arrive at the pearly gates they are greeted by Saint Peter. "Good to see you, sisters," he said. "Before I let you in to Heaven, you will each have to answer a question." He asked the first nun, "Have you ever touched a man's penis?" "Yes," she replied. "Many years ago I stumbled in a crowd and as I fell I reached out to grab hold of something to break the fall and I grabbed a man's crotch by mistake." "Fine, sister," he replied. "Go wash that hand in the holy water over there and then you will be admitted." Saint Peter asks the next nun in line, "Have you ever touched a man's penis?" "Yes. I was working in a hospital and I had to give a man a sponge bath, which included washing his penis. But that is the only time." "Go wash your hands in the holy water, and then you're all set," he replied. As he was about to ask the third nun her question, the fourth nun jumped in front of her in line. "It's not your turn yet, sister." said Saint Peter. "Well, if you think I'm gonna wash my mouth out in the holy water after sister Julie washes her ass in there, you're crazy!"

My Dad told me this army joke when I was young. It's pretty bad. [NSFW] (x-post /r/dadjokes) "When I was young and in the army, we didn't ever see any girls, going months without seeing any, in fact. Us army boys were still young, and all that pent up time going without girls made us desperate for anyone. So, when I had a break for a few days for the first time in 6 months, I went down to a bar to have a couple of drinks. An older man looked over at me, realizing that I was in the army, and told me that he had a really beautiful daughter. She was getting lonely, and he suggested that I take her out tonight. I was immediately interested, going so long and all, and as things had it I ended up following him home to meet the girl. We get to his house and I see here- she didn't have any legs. The only thing I could think of doing was going out to a drive-in. So we went out, and she was actually quite nice and funny. She also really wanted to kiss and all, which was good. So, after a good night, I take her home and we go down to her room. She tells me that she wants to have sex, so I asked her how. She told me to go to the coat closet, put a jacket on her, and hang her on the door. This sounded crazy, but being so horny, I did it. Just as we started going at it, her dad came in. I freaked out and froze there, the girl on the hanger fully unclothed besides the jacket keeping her up, and me, buck naked. I began to apologize, stuttering, but her dad said, 'What? Are you going to just leave her hanging??'"

Three American anthropologists head to an island... inhabited by a group of indigenous cannibals, in order to study the native culture. While filming the natives, the three men are captured by a savage hunting party are returned to the native's village. The Americans are told by the chief that they have one chance to save their lives. Each person must go into the jungle and bring back whatever fruit they can find. If they don't return, a hunting party will find them and skin them alive. The first anthropologist runs into the jungle to find fruit. He quickly returns with a bushel of apples within hours. The chief then tells his people that the American must put all of the apples that he brought back in his own anus. If the American makes any facial expression whatsoever, he will be killed and eaten. The American hesitates, then starts to shove the apples in his own anus, one by one. He gets two of the five apples in, but winces in pure agony on the third. The natives kill him and begin to cook him, when the second man returns, with a handful of berries. The chief explains what the man must do. Without hesitation the American starts putting the berries in his anus. He puts in three. Five. Seven. He has one berry left, but then out of nowhere he starts laughing. The natives are confused, but since he broke the rule, he is immediately killed. In heaven, the first anthropologist meets up with the second one. He says, "Dude, you were so close! You could have survived! Why on earth did you laugh?" The second guy chuckles and says, "I saw our buddy returning with pineapples."

All the single ladles Joe invited his mother over for dinner one night. During the course of said dinner his mother couldn't help but notice the staggering beauty of Joe's roommate. She had been long suspicious of a relationship between them, and her beauty combined with the banter she had seen them share only made her all the more curious. Joe noticed his mother's suspicion. "I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you that Julie and I are just roommates." A week later, Julie came to Joe and said, "Ever since your mother came to dinner, I can't seem to find the gravy ladle. You don't suppose she took it on accident, do you?" Joe agreed that it was a reasonable possibility, and wrote a letter to his mother inquiring about the ladle. It read, "I'm not saying you 'did' take the ladle, nor am I saying you 'did not' take the ladle,' but the fact is it's been missing since you came to dinner last week." Several weeks later, a reply came. "I'm not saying you 'do' sleep with Julie, nor am I saying you 'do not' sleep with Julie. The fact is if she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the ladle by now."

Old Russian Joke A father is waiting for his kid to be born in the hospital. He's super nervous, pacing back and forth, cigars in his breast pocket ready to go. After what seems like a several days, a doctor finally walks into the waiting room and asks who's waiting for the baby. The father runs up to the doctor. Doctor: "You have a baby boy." Father: "I'm so happy!! I've always wanted a boy! I'm a huge soccer fan and I can't wait to play soccer with my son, go to all his games and watch become a great player!" Doctor: "I don't know how to tell you this sir, but your son was born without any legs." The father fights back some tears, but bounces back pretty quickly. Father: "You know what, that's ok, my wife is a brilliant piano player, and she's always wanted to pass down her love of music to our child. She'll teach him to play beautiful music, we'll go to all his concerts, we'll be so proud of him." Doctor: "I'm sorry sir, but your son was kind of born without any arms." Now the father has a much harder time holding back the tears. He takes a minute to collect himself. Father: "You know, I'm a god fearing man, and I'm sure god had a plan for my son, and I guess that plan has to involve him having a brilliant mind, and he'll solve world problems, and go down in history as one of the great thinkers!" Doctor: "....sir I don't know quite how to say this, but your son was kind of born without a head." The father starts to cry and getting really upset. Father: "Just take me to see my son, I want to see him." The doctor takes the father down a long hallway, and in this operating room is this gigantic perfect ear. The father starts sobbing, and through his cries he's speaking to his son, Father: "Son I'm so sorry this had to happen to you, but I don't want you to worry, we're going to have a great life together, we'll do all the things fathers and sons do." Then the doctor leans over to the father and says, Doctor: "You have to speak up, he can't hear well." There you have it. Good ol' russian humor. 30 dick punches, and then a tasteful nut tap. Hope you enjoyed this episode of Old Russian Joke.

Russian Car Joke [This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1sv7r1/old_russian_joke/) reminded me of this joke I'd heard years ago: We're in Soviet Russia in the early 80's and Vladimir has been hoarding his spare rubles for years and years in order to be able to purchase a car. The big day finally arrives; he's finally saved up enough. He goes to the Ministry of Motor Vehicles and after waiting in line for 5 hours, he is finally face-to-face with a bureaucrat and Vladimir proudly announces, "I would like to purchase a car!" The bureaucrat takes Vlad's rubles, counts them, counts them, counts them again. Then he wordlessly throws Vlad a pile of paperwork which Vlad dutifully fills out (in triplicate!) so that they can proceed. The bureaucrat examines all the paperwork, makes Vladimir re-do some of the pages he screwed up, and then makes his determination: "I have examined your paperwork and it is sufficient. The rubles you have paid me are sufficient. You can purchase a car. Come back 10 years from today and your car will be ready." Unfazed by this, Vlad asks, "Will it be ready in the morning or the afternoon?" The bureaucrat is stunned... "Morning or afternoon? Morning or afternoon? It's 10 years from today! Why do you care if it's in the morning or afternoon?" Vladimir replies, "Well, it's just that the plumber's coming by in the morning..."

A Modern Islamic Couple are getting married.. A modern Islamic couple preparing for a religious wedding meet with their Mullah for counseling. The Mullah asks if they have any last questions before they leave. The man says, "We realize it's tradition in Islam for men to dance with men, and women to dance with women. But, at our wedding reception, we'd like your permission to dance together. " "Absolutely not," says the Mullah. "It's immoral. Men and women always dance separately. " "So, after the ceremony I can't even dance with my own wife? " " No , " answers the Mullah. " It ' s forbidden in Islam . " "Well, OK," says the man. "What about sex? Can we finally have sex? " " Of course ! " replies the Mullah. " AlIa ho Akber ! Sex is OK within a marriage to have children ! " "What about different positions?" asks the man. "AlIa ho Akber! No problem," says the Mullah. "Woman on top?" the man asks. "Sure," says the Mullah. "AlIa ho Akber. Go for it!" "Doggy style?" "Sure! AlIa ho Akber! " "On the kitchen table?" "Yes, yes! AlIaho Akber!" "Can I do it with all my four wives together on rubber sheets with a bottle of hot oil, a couple of vibrators, leather harnesses, a bucket of honey and a porno video?" " You may, indeed. AlIa ho Akber ! " "Can we do it standing up?" "No," says the Mullah. "Why not?" asks the man. "Because that could lead to dancing."

A bit of logic In the 1950s, a man goes home one day and sees a moving truck at his neighbor's house. He then inquires and sees a man who is clearly moving in. Being friendly, he walks up to his neighbor and welcomes him to the neighborhood. He then asks what the newcomer's profession is. The man was a professor at the local university, and he taught logic. When the man learned this, he asked the professor what logic was, so the professor began: "I see you have a doghouse, so you have dog. I see the doghouse is large so you have a large dog. If you have a large dog you probably have a family. If you have a family, you have children. If you have children, you have a wife, and if you have a wife, you are heterosexual." The man understood and was interested, promising to come back to learn some more later. The next day he went to the bar with his friends and told him about his new neighbor. When they asked what he did, the man said he'd give an example. He asked his buddy, "Do you have a dog?" "Nope" "Well then you're a fucking faggot."

There once was an old cathedral in rural England... There once was an old cathedral in rural England. It was near a small village and most of the people that lived there attended church every week. This was a sad time for the people of this village, as the much beloved bell ringer for the church had fallen ill and died. The head minister of this cathedral had taken the death quite hardly, as he had been good friends with the man. Reluctantly, he put up a notice in the village square that they would be needing a replacement bell ringer. He knew that a man for the job was needed before the funeral of the old ringer. Now, the day after notice was posted, the minister was in his study reading when a young man no older than 20 walked in. The minister looked up and asked, "What can I do for you, young man?" The man, visibly eager to speak, replied, "I'm here about the posting you've made. I want to be the next bell ringer." There was an enthusiasm on this man's face that caught the minister's attention. The minister, somewhat recognizing this enthusiasm, inquired, "Well that may be something we could discuss. But first, I must know, have I seen you here at the church or around town? You seem rather familiar." "No, sir, I don't believe we've met before," the man replied. "Ah, well then, it's very nice to make your acquaintance," said the minister. He reached out to shake the young man's hand, when he noticed something very out of the ordinary. The man had no arms! The minister pulled back his hand and apologized for the gesture. "It's no problem, sir, I've been without them for my whole life, I'm quite used to that." The man redirected the conversation back to the job. "Now, I'd really like to talk about becoming the next bell ringer!" The minister, slightly taken aback, wondered whether the armless man was serious. "My dear boy, surely you must be joking. You've got no arms! I mean no offense, but there is no way you could pull those heavy ropes to ring the bells." The young man still had an eagerness about him, insisting that the minister give him a shot. "I can do it, let me show you! Please sir, I know I can do it. Come with me up the bell tower and I'll show you!" At this point, the minister was wondering whether the man had some sort of brain damage as well. There was absolutely no way a man with no arms could ring those bells. But, being the generous man that he was, the minister decided to at least humor the man and go up into the bell tower with him. Once they reached the top of the tower where the bells were held, the minister asked how the young man was going to ring them. "Like this," he simply replied with an odd smile on his face. The man took some step back towards one open arches that made up the bell tower, disregarding the ropes that hung next to him. He began walking slowly, then burst into a sprint, jumped, and smacked his forehead on the edge of the bell. BWOOOOOOOOONNNG The minister couldn't believe it. This armless man had just mad the most beautiful sound he'd ever heard come out of that bell. Astounded, he turned to the man and exclaimed, "Dear boy, did you really just do that?" Unfazed, the young man responded excitedly, "Yes sir! Would you like me to do it again?" Without waiting for an answer, the man once again stepped back to the arch, took a running start, jumped, and smacked his forehead against the bell. BWOOOOOOOOONNNG Now, the minister was truly speechless. Although his previous thoughts about brain damage were almost certainly proven, he simply could not believe how beautiful the sound was that the bell made. He looked at the man, seeing no sign of harm to his head, but only a smile that showed how confident he was. The minister then made the final decision to make this young man the next bell ringer. A few days had passed, and it was time for the funeral for the former ringer. Nearly the entire village showed up to mourn his passing. As the funeral dragged on as only funerals can, the newly appointed ringer made his way up the tower to give the bells a good BWONG-ing after the final eulogy had ended. This was his biggest break, his chance to show the entire village that he could be a great ringer. The excitement from that first day had swelled up until this point. He listed for the sound of the last "Amen" from the congregation. It was his time now. The armless man closed his eyes to take it all in. After a deep sigh, he took some steps back, broke into a run, jumped, and smacked his forehead on the edge of the bell. Then, to his surprise, he tripped on a large old nail as he landed, stumbled toward one of the arches, and, unable to balance himself, fell out of the tower to his death. BWOOOOOOOOONNNG ... ... ... SPLAT! The funeral-goers heard this strange sound and all rushed outside to see what was the matter. To their surprise, they found the newly appointed ringer dead on the ground. The crowd began talking among themselves, wondering who knew this man and whether any of his family was present. One man thought he had recognized the deceased man earlier with a family, but couldn't quite put his finger on it whether it was him or not. Everyone could agree that this man looked familiar. As the minister finally reached the body through the crowd, he knelt down and wept beside him. A woman in the crowd asked, "Father, did you know who this man was?" "No," he solemnly answered, "but his face sure rang a bell."

A great Vacation One day, at little Hill mental institution in NY, nurse Nancy was making her rounds and checking on the patients. She comes to Bob's room and takes a peek inside to make sure everything is alright. Bob is folding all of his clothes and everything in his room is laid out neatly on the bed. Being unusual, Nancy asks bob what he's doing... "Everything ok Bob?" she asks. Bob replies " Ohh yes, I'm just packing for Chicago!, I'm taking a vacation" and he goes about his way. Nancy just shakes her head and finishes the rounds.... Next day, Nancy is doing her rounds and again check on Bob. This time Bob is sitting on his bed and mimicking driving and he's waving and smiling. "Bob, everything ok?" Nancy inquires. " Ohhh yes nurse, I just arrived in Chicago. It's so nice here" Satisfied with her patients glee, Nancy leaves him be and checks on Rodney in the next room. As she looks in, she sees Rodney jerking off furiously and humping his bed and thrashing... "RODNEY!!! What on earth are you doing?!?!?!" she asks, grossed out. Rodney stops a sec, wipes the sweat from his brow and bellows "I'm fucking Bob's wife while he's in Chicago!!!!!"

A dystopian future Mr. and Mrs. Thyme are two people living in a dystopian future where babies are assigned a random combination of letters and numbers for a name, such as DL-6 or UR-1. However, due to a large amount of protesters, the law has been changed so that parents can choose their own name if they run to the city hall to change the name in 30 minutes after the baby is born. Mrs. Thyme was pregnant, and her water had broken that morning. However Mr. Thyme had to work for the day, and he had an important meeting that he couldn't miss. He arrived at the hospital 15 minutes after the birth, and Mrs. Thyme said "Hello, dear! Isn't our baby precious?" Mr. Thyme nodded in approval. He suddenly remembered the law, and exclaimed "I have to go to the city hall!" and ran off. 20 minutes later, Mr. Thyme came back. "Did you name our son?" Mrs. Thyme asked. "Yes," Mr. Thyme responded, "Justin Thyme."
A rather long winded joke, read all of it to get the punchline... Right, so there was this guy that lost his eye in a car accident, and after losing it he hadn't been out of his house much, aside from having to go shopping, because he was so embarrassed. One day his friends come over to his house, and they say "look man, you've got to come to the dance next week, it'll be fun, and you haven't done anything in ages." The man stubbornly refuses, until his friends stop pestering him about it, but the next day, they come back, and say "well, we've got a bit if a surprise for you... We've put together enough money to buy you a fake eye." The man says "that's great! thanks so much!" His friends then say, "but, you have to promise to come to the dance once you've got one. The man thinks it over, he's still a bit embarrassed, but eventually agree. So the man and his friends drive to the eye store and walk up to the man at the counter. "Hello," says one of the eyeless mans friends, "we're here to buy a fake eye for our friend here, do you have any in stock?" The nan at the counter says "we certainly do, and walks into the back of the shop, returning later with a box of beautiful glass eyes. "These a very good quality eyes," the man said "they're hand painted, and we have a match for pretty much any eye colour. "Great!" Says one of the mans friends, "how much do they cost?" "Well" says the man at the counter, "these are very good quality, so you're looking at around $1500 to $2000" "well" says the mans friend, "we don't really have that much to spend... Do you have any others?" "Certainly," says the man at the counter who puts the lid back on the glass eyes, walks into the back of the shop, coming back with a box full of plastic eyes. "These ones are also hand painted, but they aren't as well-painted as the glass eyes, and they aren't quite as matching, but they are still rather indistinguishable from normal eyes. "Right," say the mans friends, "how much do they cost?" "Um... These," says the salesman "will cost around $900" "sorry," says the man to his friend, "but we don't have quite enough for those, either. Do you have any more?" He says, turning back to the man at the counter. "We do have some wood eyes, says the man at the counter," he then produces a box from under the counter. "These wood eyes aren't hand painted, and won't be able to get a really good colour match, but we can find a passable colour, I'm sure." Says the man at the counter, " and they'll only cost about $120" "right" says the eyeless mans friend, "we'll take this one then." He takes a dark green eye from the box, and gives it to his friend, handing the man at the counter the money. The friends drive home, trying to cheer the eyeless man up, as they eye isn't entirely convincing. "It's okay," says the eyeless mans friend it'll be fine, it won't even be that light at the dance, and your eye won't show." So the man reluctantly goes to the dance the next week. Once arriving at the dance, the man sits alone in a corner until everyone else has a dance partner. The mans three friends come over to him, and encourage him to get a partner, "how about her over there?" The mans friend points to a woman sitting alone in a corner on the other side of the room. "Come on," prompts his friend "you can't have come all this way for nothing." "Alright," says the man, "I'll ask her to dance. As he walks over he realises the lady has a bit of a hunch back, and starts having second thoughts. "I'm no better" says the man to himself, and someone's up his courage and asks her to dance. "Would you like to have an dance" asks the man. "Would I!? Would I!?" Asks the woman. "Hunch back! Hunch back! Yells the man and runs back to the corner.

Difference between Ravens and Crows I work in a gift-shop up in southeast Alaska. Our store is right under a tree that houses a family of angry crows. Tourists often ask me how I can tell the difference between ravens and crows. I tell them this: "All birds have specialized tail feathers that help with flight in Alaska's thin, cold air. These feathers are called pinions. If you look closely you can tell that ravens have four of these feathers while crows only have three. I guess you could say it's just a matter of a pinion."

An alcoholic, a chain-smoker and a homosexual walk into a bar... ...and each sit at a bar stool. After a couple of drinks a psychic approaches them and tells each one of them how they were going to die. He said to the alcoholic: "If you drink one more time, you are going to die." He says to the chain-smoker "If you smoke one more time, you are going to die." Finally he says to the homosexual "If you get turned on by a man one more time, you are going to die." The psychic left right after leaving the 3 men baffled and confused. "I call bull-shit! There's no way that's even possible!" exclaimed the alcoholic just as he took one big drink of his beer. He quickly collapsed and died right there on the bar floor. Both the homosexual and the chain-smoker were horrified as they realized that the psychic was right about his predictions. After taking their friend to the hospital they both leave and start walking to their car. Just then, the chain smoker spotted a full carton of cigarettes right outside of his car. "Dude no way! Today's my lucky day!" Just as the chain-smoker was about about to pick up the carton, the homosexual shouted: "STOP! If you bend over to pick them up, we're both going to die."

the golf course frog A golfer playing a round by himself hits his ball near a pond. As he approaches the ball he notices a small frog right next to the spot where his ball landed. Not wanting to hit the frog, he bends down and moves the frog onto a rock nearby. As he sets up his 8 iron shot, he hears the frog croak 'ribbit 9 iron'. Strange, he thought but what the heck. He pulls out his 9 iron and hits a perfect shot onto the green, 2 feet from the pin. With a smile he turns to the frog and said 'you must be my lucky charm'. The frog hops onto his cart and proceeds to tell him the exact perfect club for each shot that day and the man ends up shooting the round of his life. Following the round of golf, beer in hand, the man smiled at the frog and said 'you must be my lucky charm'. With something near a smile (or as close as an amphibian can get), the frog said 'ribbit Vegas'. On a whim, the man buys a plane ticket and flies with the small frog, in his carry on to las Vegas. Sitting on the mans shoulder, the frog proceeded to tell him which roulette numbers to play to the point where the man was up tens of thousands of dollars. The winning streak continued all night and caught the attention of the pit boss, who comped the man a room in their finest suite. Sitting in the suites hit tub and enjoying a $500 bottle of fine cognac, the man turned to the frog and said 'I don't know how to thank you. You gave me the greatest golf round I've ever played and now more money than I can earn in 3 years. Is there anything I can do for you?' The frog looked the man in the eyes and said 'Ribbit, kiss me'. After a wince, the man thinks what the heck and picks the frog up and gives it a kiss. Like magic, the frog suddenly turned into a beautiful, blond, naked...14 year old girl. ...and I swear, your honor, that's exactly how she ended up in my room!

Baked Beans. One day I met a sweet woman and fell in love. When it became apparent that we would marry, I made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans. Some months later, on my birthday, my car broke down on the way home from work. Since I lived in the countryside I called my wife and told her that I would be late because I had to walk home. On my way, I passed by a small diner and the odour of baked beans was more than I could stand. With miles to walk, I figured that I would walk off any ill effects by the time I reached home, so I stopped at the diner and before I knew it, I had consumed three large orders of baked beans. All the way home, I made sure that I released all the gas. Upon my arrival, my wife seemed excited to see! me and exclaimed delightedly: "Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight." She then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a seat and just as she was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. She made me promise not to touch the blindfold until she returned and went to answer the call. The baked beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming most unbearable, so while my wife was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a pulpwood mill. I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other cheek, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable. When eventually the telephone farewells signalled the end of my freedom, I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my wife returned, apologizing for taking so long. She asked me if I had peeked through the blindfold, and I assured her I had not. At this point, she removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table chorused: "Happy Birthday!"

An old Jewish joke. Rabbi Altmann and his secretary were sitting in a coffeehouse in Berlin in 1935. "Herr Altmann," said his secretary, "I notice you're reading Der Sturmer! I can't understand why. A Nazi libel sheet! Are you some kind of masochist, or, God forbid, a self-hating Jew?" "On the contrary, Frau Epstein. When I used to read the Jewish papers, all I learned about were pogroms, riots in Palestine, and assimilation in America. But now that I read Der Sturmer, I see so much more: that the Jews control all the banks, that we dominate in the arts, and that we're on the verge of taking over the entire world. You know  it makes me feel a whole lot better!"

Elephant at the Zoo [Copied from this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1t3pl5/while_at_disneys_animal_kingdom_my_5_year_old/) * A mother is walking with her five year-old son through the zoo when they reach the elephant cage. The boy looks with amazement at the large beast and asks his mom, "What's that long thing hanging down from the elephant?" His mother replies "That's his trunk". The little boy goes, "I know that, the thing to the other side of the trunk." The mom replies "Oh, that's his tail". The boy goes, "I know that! No, what's that big thing hanging down in between the trunk and tail." The mother, wanting to avoid this subject all together, just says "Oh, that's nothing" and whisks him off to the next exhibit. Two weeks later he goes to the same zoo with his dad. They are at the elephant exhibit and he asks his dad "What's that long thing hanging down from the elephant?" The dad replies, "That's his trunk." "No, behind that!" says the kid. "Oh, well that's his tail" replies the father. "NO, in-between the trunk and the tail!" yells the kid. His dad replies, "Son, that's the elephant's penis." The kid, a bit puzzled, tells his dad, "But Mom said it was nothing." His father replied, "Son, that's because your mom's been spoiled."

"I'm sorry I really am, I don't know what came over me. I promise it won't happen again. Now what seems to be the problem?" The guy starts sobbing and says "It's swollen."

After about an hour, he to comes out of the room and says "that's the mother of my children. I can't do it". He gets sent home. The Green Beret then goes in the room. Immediately there is screaming, slapping, tables and glass breaking. The other two standing outside wondering what the fuck is going on. Finally the noise ends and the Green Beret comes back out, scratched, bloody and bruised.

Ving and Ling Earlier this year, a chinese family moved into my small town. The family had two twins who were both seniors in my class, Ving and Ling. Ving and his sister Ling were quiet to start off with, but eventually I made good friends with Ving. After talking to him for a few weeks he revealed to me that he absolutely *abhored* his name, and that he'd do almost anything to figure out how to get it changed. I asked him what he wanted to change it to, and he said "lee, like bruce lee or some shit." I was failing trigonometry at the time, and so I thought what the hell, and offered to help him in exchange for him doing my homework. Ling overheard us and chimed in, "If you do that, father will disown you as our child. That name has been in our family line for generations." Ving never really listened to his sister though, and he still wanted to go through with the plan. The next day after school, I drove him to the town hall. After we arrived, he had gotten the name-change sheet and was scribbling down information on to it when I saw his face change. I could tell he was extremely conflicted with his choice. Tears began to stream down his face. He finally decided that he was gonna have to cancel his request, and Ling looked relieved. The receptionist let us know that there would be a cancelation fee, and handed the fee waiver to her. Suddenly, A short asian man with neon shorts, ray-bans, and an american flag t-shirt bursted into the room. Ving turned in awe and stared at the man, as tears rolled down his cheeks. "D-D-Dad?" With a huge smile on his face, the man ran up and embraced his son. "Don't stop, be Lee, Ving. Hold on the that fee, Ling" _______________________________________________________ ***Yes, this is a modified version of a joke from a 4chan thread. I found it in /r/4chan and modified it into a more readable format. All credit for the joke goes to the anon who wrote it. Peace.***

5 Year Old's First Job Here's a truly heartwarming story about the bond formed between a little 5-year-old girl and some construction workers that will make you believe that we all can make a difference when we give a child the gift of our time. A young family moved into a house, next to a vacant lot. One day, a Construction crew turned up to start building a house on the empty lot. The young family's 5-year-old daughter naturally took an interest in all the activity going on next door and spent much of each day observing the workers. Eventually the construction crew, all of them "gems-in-the-rough," more or less, adopted her as a kind of project mascot. They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important. At the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars. The little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars "pay" she'd received to the bank the next day to start a savings account. When the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age.. The little girl proudly replied, "I worked last week with a real construction crew building the new house next door to us." "Oh my goodness gracious," said the teller, "and will you be working on the house again this week, too?" The little girl replied, "I will, if those assholes at Home Depot ever deliver the damn sheet rock..." Kind of brings a tear to the eye - doesn't it?

Holidays With the Holidays upon us I would like to share a personal experience with my friends about drinking and driving. As you may know some of us have been known to have brushes with the authorities from time to time on the way home after a "social session" out with friends. Well, two days ago I was out for an evening with friends and had several cocktails followed by some rather nice red wine. Feeling jolly I still had the sense to know that I may be slightly over the limit. That's when I did something that I've never done before - I took a cab home. Sure enough on the way home there was a police road block, but since it was a cab they waved it past. I arrived home safely without incident. This was a real surprise as I had never driven a cab before, I don't know where I got it and now that it's in my garage I don't know what to do with it.

" and Satan says: "Well, it's great, I've got an engineer down here and he has build air conditioning, running water, flushing toilets, and I don't know what else, he's gonna build next. Then God asks, "You've got an engineer down there?" "That's a big mistake, send him up here right now!" and Satan replies, "No way this is the best thing that's ever happened to hell." and God says, "send him up or I'll sue!!" and Satan says smirking, "Now just where are you gonna get a lawyer??"

Cheating for "Good" Reasons An elderly couple was having dinner one evening when the husband reached across the table, took his wife's hand in his and said, "Martha, soon we will be married 50 years, and there's something I have to know. In all of these 50 years, have you ever been unfaithful to me?" Martha replied, "Well Henry, I have to be honest with you. Yes, I've been unfaithful to you three times during these 50 years, but always for a good reason. Henry was obviously hurt by his wife's confession, but said, "I never suspected. Can you tell me what you mean by 'good reasons?'" Martha said, "The first time was shortly after we were married, and we were about to lose our little house because we couldn't pay the mortgage. Do you remember that one evening I went to see the banker and the next day he notified you that the loan would be extended?" Henry recalled the visit to the banker and said, "I can forgive you for that. You saved our home, but what about the second time?" Martha asked, "And do you remember when you were so sick, but we didn't have the money to pay for the heart surgery you needed? Well, I went to see your doctor one night and, if you recall, he did the surgery at no charge." "I recall that," said Henry. "And you did it to save my life, so of course I can forgive you for that. Now tell me about the third time." "Alright," Martha said. "So do you remember when you ran for president of your golf club, and you needed 73 more votes?"

Communication Problem! There was this Asian lady married to an Spanish gentleman and they lived in Spain. The poor lady was not very proficient in Spanish, but managed to communicate with her husband. The real problem arose whenever she had to shop for groceries. One day, she went to the butcher and wanted to buy pork legs. She didn't know how to put forward her request, and in desperation, lifted up her skirt to show her thighs. The butcher got the message and the lady went home with pork legs. The next day, she needed to get chicken breasts. Again, she didn't know how to say, and so she unbuttoned her blouse to show the butcher her breast. The lady got what she wanted. The 3rd day, the poor lady needed to buy sausages. Unable to find a way to communicate this, she brought her husband to the store... What were you thinking? Helloooooooooo, her husband speaks Spanish!!!

Little Johnny Strikes Again The teacher asked the class to use the word 'fascinate' in a sentence. Molly put up her hand and said, "My family went to my granddad's farm, and we all saw his pet sheep. It was fascinating." The teacher said, "That was good, but I wanted you to use the word fascinate, not fascinating." Sally raised her hand. She said, "My family went to see RockCity and I was fascinated." The teacher said, "Well, that was good Sally, but I wanted you to use the word fascinate." Little Johnny raised his hand. The teacher hesitated because she had been burned by Little Johnny before. She finally decided there was no way he could damage the word 'fascinate', so she called on him. Johnny said, "My aunt Gina has a sweater with ten buttons, but her boobs are so big she can only fasten eight." The teacher sat down and cried.

All I want... When I was in jr. high, all I wanted was a girl with big tits. In high school, I dated a girl with big tits, but there was no passion. So I decided I needed a passionate girl. In college, I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything was an emergency, she cried all the time. So I decided I needed a girl with some stability. I found a very stable girl, but she was boring. She never got excited about anything. So I decided I needed a girl with some excitement. I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She was directionless. So I decided to find a girl with some ambition. After college, I found an ambitious girl and married her. She was so ambitious, she divorced me and took everything I owned. Now all I want is a girl with big tits.

Rural Justice A reporter from the city was writing a feature story about rural justice, and it so happened that on the day he was observing, sentencing came up in two felony cases. In the first case, a man was sentenced for Murder in the 2nd degree, in which he had killed his wife's lover. He received 15 years, probated to 3. In the second case, a man was convicted for stealing a neighbor's prized hog. The value of the hog made it a felony, and the judge meted out a full five year term, no probation. After court was over for the day the reporter asked the judge how it was he could effectively give a murderer three years while giving a thief five years. The judge replied, "Son, in my days on the bench, I've met a lot of men that needed killing, but not one hog that needed stealing."

Help needed to workshop owl-based joke. With an accomplice it works fine, I'm trying to get it to work with any random. Here's the stage it's at so far. Someone you know told me that you do a really good owl impression. Who? Oh, I thought it would be better than that. The problem is that most people's initial response isn't "Who?" but "Owl?". I'm trying to phrase it to elucidate the former but I've run out people I know to test it on. I'm not even sure it's possible, or worth it for that matter. THANKS!

Jesus' Prank Jesus was going door to door spreading the word of God and giving out wreaths for goodwill. He came across someone who wasn't happy to see him, got the door slammed on him, and went on to the next house. Turns out the man was RA, the Egyptian sun god. "The nerve!" He said. "Trying to tell me there is only one true god and it's not me. I'm the sun god!" Then he noticed a wreath sitting on his doorstep. Furious, he brought it inside and proceeded to have sex with it. Fucked the wreath to pieces, because heathen gods do weird things like that. "There! That'll show em!" He then went to pee, and noticed a burning sensation. Jesus knew it was RA all along, and had god (old testament) infect the wreath with STDs! Then RA got a text message from jesus, which also happens to be the punchline: How's Ur wreath RA?! Heard it's in rough shape lol!

There was once a great Polynesian king He lived in a magnificent palace made of woven grass and sat on a beautiful throne. One day another kingdom gave him a gift: a new throne, even more exquisite than the one he already had. The king wanted to replace his old throne right away, but he didn't want to just throw it away; he had so many good memories tied to it! Instead, he had it moved to the attic, and then he proceeded to sit on his new throne. Unfortunately, since the palace was made of woven grass, it couldn't support the weight of the old throne. Thus the old throne came crashing down, falling on top of the king and killing him instantly. The moral of the story: Those who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones!

Blind Man!!! Nun Too Smart The Mother Superior tells two new nuns that they have to paint their room without getting any paint on their clothes. After thinking about the task for a moment, one nun says to the other, "Hey, let's take all our clothes off, fold them up, and lock the door."

The nuns look at each other, then one nun says, "He's blind, he can't see. What could it hurt," and they let him in. The blind man walks in and says, "Hey, nice tits. Where do you want me to hang the blinds?"

Little Timmy Grandpa watched Timmy pull a worm out of the ground and told him that if he could put it back in he would give him 10 bucks. Timmy left for a bit and said "Ok Grandpa, watch this". Timmy then pushed the worm right back down the hole it came out from. Grandpa got out the 10 bucks and gave it to Timmy. Timmy said "Grandpa, I cant keep this because I cheated. I sprayed the worm with hair spray. That's why I was able to do that." Grandpa said "No, you keep it." The next morning at breakfast Grandpa walked to Timmy and gave him another 10 bucks. Timmy said "No Grandpa. You already paid me." Grandpa replied "That money was from Grandma."
Aging A young married couple was invited to their friend's home for dinner one evening. Their host was an elderly 82-year-old couple. The young couple was impressed by the way the elderly man preceded every request to his wife with endearing terms like: "Darling, Sugar, Dear, Honey, Sweetheart," etc. When the young man was alone with the old man in the veranda, the young man said, "I know both of you have been married for over 60 years and you are still so in love with one another. It's so wonderful after being married for so many years, you can still call your wife those loving pet names." The old man sighed, "To tell you the truth, I forgot her name about 20 years ago."

Ever wonder how the seven dwarves got their names? Miss Snow White was a randy cow, And desperate for a fuck. So off she went into the woods, To try and get some luck! She'd almost given up looking, When she saw some chimney smoke. Then stumbled on a cottage, And went in for a poke. Her clothes came off in seconds. And she'd just removed her pants, When seven Dwarves came marching in, With a merry song and dance. Snow White just stood there speechless, And thought she was in heaven! Originally after one good shag, But now she could have seven. Straight away she took command, "My fanny need a lick!" And when one dwarf moved forward, She said "Oi-you'd better drop you pick!" So down he went onto all fours, And said "I ain't licking that!" "Not there, that me arse-hole, You DOPEY little brat!" The next dwarf started blushing, "Do we have to do it here?" Snow White said "Don't be BASHFUL! Unless you're fucking queer!" So reluctantly he whipped it out, To prove he was no fool. And Snow White gave a big "Heigh-Ho" As she rode upon his tool. Now one dwarf wasn't smiling, 'Cos he hadn't had a sniff. And due to his impatience, He couldn't raise a stiff. "Relax, you GRUMPY bastard", So he did as he was told. And as soon as he was hard enough, He shot his fucking load. The next dwarf got a blow job, And she took him in quite easy. But she just avoided brain-damage, Whe he sneezed, she called him SNEEZY. With three dwarves left, she turned and said, "You're next, I want your knob!" But no sooner had he entered her, Than he was sleeping on the job. "Wake up you SLEEPY idiot" She wanted more from him. And he woke with such excitement, That he filled her hairy quim. The next dwarf rammed his up her, And shagged her fanny raw. And dazed Snow White then whimpered, "That should be against the law!" He made poor Snow White tremble, He was so big and thick. "No wonder you're so HAPPY, With that fucking great big dick." With one dwarf still remaining, But feeling rather sore, She said "You'll have to use your tongue, My clit can't take no more.!" And so he put his tongue to work, Where others had put their cocks. And 'cos he made Snow White feel better, She named the last one DOC. Now Snow White couldn't do much, With all that cum inside her quim, So she grabbed a cup, and squatted, And filled it to the brim. So there's the truth about the dwarves, And how they got their names, By satisfying miss Snow White, And joining in her games. There's one more thing you need to know, And that's what happened to that cup? Well think of what you're drinking... When you next buy 7-UP!! -DISCLAIMER- As much as I'd love to say I wrote this, I didn't. Someone sent this masterpiece to me and I'm just passing it along. If the original author is out there, let me thank you for this!

An elderly couple celebrate their 50th anniversary. A man in a restaurant overhears an elderly couple next to him celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. "Dear do you remember 50 years ago when I proposed to you right here in this same spot?" the old man asks caressing his wife's hand. "Yes honey I do remember." she replies smiling. "Do you remember after you said yes we went out back and made passionate love?" he asks with a devilish grin. "Oh yes I remember." she answers coyly. "Want to do it again?" The younger man overhearing this watches as the old lady nods enthusiastically and grabbing their canes the elderly couple head out the back entrance. Glancing around to see if anyone else has noticed he decides to follow them, not believing what the elderly couple are doing. He peeks out the back door into the ally and freezes in astonishment at what he observes. The old lady is bent over grabbing a fence with her dress hiked up while behind her the old man has his trousers around his ankles and is thrusting vigorously. The old couple scream and moan as they make wild passionate love for over 30 minutes finally collapsing to the ground covered in sweat, their chests heaving from the exertion. The young man rushes up as the elderly pair lay gasping and exclaims, "My God are you alright? I don't want to seem like a pervert but I am in shock how after 50 years and at your age you can still make love like that!" The grey haired lady tries to compose herself, smoothing out her dress she looks up from the ground and haggardly replies,"You're in shock? 50 years ago that fucking fence wasn't electrified!"

Not sure if this is the right place for this but it was suggested I cross-post here (from ShittyPoetry). So here's my holiday story, 'Twas The Night Before Fapmas. Enjoy! 'Twas the night before Fapmas, alone in my house One hand on my penis, the other on the mouse Her stockings were drawn up to her tight thighs with care And above her lady bits she had shaved off her hair The actress was disrobed all bare on her bed When entered a hung dude about to get head My hand it was lubed up all warm in my lap I had just settled in for a long winter's fap My lips formed a grin like a perverted Mad Hatter And took to my deed with the goal of a splatter Away to my penis I started to mash As the man in the film mounted for a big smash The sheen on her breasts looked of new fallen snow With the glean of saliva from a slop given blow When what to my wondering eyes should appear But another guy entering the chick by the rear With his cock he did drive her so lively and quick I knew in a moment this guy gave mad dick More rapid than eagles his member it came And he grunted, and shouted, and called out her name "Now Jenna! Or Sasha! Or Amy! Or Jennifer On Lisa! Or Eva! Or Sylvia or whoever! To the top of the car hood! Up against the wall! Now hump away! Hump away! Hump away all!" As the lube on my member through friction did dry I reached for the bottle for which to apply A squeeze and in seconds the fluid did spew With a new dose of KY it was time for round two And then, in a twinkling, I heard like a spoof The chick say "I'm cumming" though there was zero proof As I worked on my head and was squirming around Down her chimney he drove with an exerted sound He was dressed in birthday suit, from his head to his foot And his unit had no marks from the place it was put His bundle of toys had her now on her back And he looked like a guy about to unload his sack Her eyes  how they twinkled! Her breasts were so merry! Her cheeks were like roses, as re-popped her cherry! Her droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow And the beard of his chin tickled her down below The stump of his pipe she held soft in her teeth And she wrapped her lips around his hard piece like a wreath He had a broad face and a little round belly That shook when he pumped like a bowl full of jelly He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself A wink of his eye and as he got himself head Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work And filled all her stockings; I continued to jerk And laying his load all over her nose He let out a sigh and triumphantly rose He sprang to his feet and gave his friend a whistle And away they flew out like the down of a thistle All covered in semen the porn star was a sight "Happy Fapmas to all, and to all a good-night"

Three men shipwreck on an island known for cannibals. As they wander the jungle they are captured by these cannibals and put in a cage. The biggest and ugliest cannibal approaches the cage and says "Now we're fun loving cannibals and we like to play games. We'll give you a chance to escape for our amusement, with one item of your choice. If you get to the beach, then you'll be taken back to society. If you fail we shall kill you, skin you, eat you, and turn you into a canoe. Good luck." The first man wants to go the traditional route and chooses a gun. As he runs to the beach, he runs out of ammo and the cannibals catch him, skin him, eat him, and turn him into a canoe. The second man asks for a horse. They begrudgingly give him their only horse, and he rides towards the beach, but the cannibals spear him off the horse and skin him, eat him, and turn him into a canoe. The third man asks for a fork. The cannibals give him a funny look and fetch him a fork. The man begins to stab himself all over. The cannibals ask him why he's making their job easier and he yells "Try and make a canoe out of me now!"

Speeding Drivers Sitting on the side of the highway waiting to catch speeding drivers, a State Police Officer see's a car puttering along at 22 MPH. He thinks to himself, "This driver is just as dangerous as a speeder!"So he turns on his lights and pulls the driver over. Approaching the car, he notices that there are five old ladies, two in the front seat and three in the back, wide eyed and white as ghosts. The driver, obviously confused, says to him, "Officer, I don't understand, I was doing exactly the speed limit! What seems to be the problem?" "Ma'am," the officer replies, "You weren't speeding, but you should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a danger to other drivers." "Slower than the speed limit? No sir, I was doing the speed limit exactly twenty-two miles an hour!" the old woman says a bit proudly. The State Police officer, trying to contain a chuckle explains to her that "22" was the route number, not the speed limit. A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error. "But before I let you go, Ma'am, I have to ask... Is everyone in this car OK? These women seem awfully shaken and they haven't muttered a single peep this whole time," the officer asks. "Oh, they'll be all right in a minute officer. We just got off Route 142."

An elderly lady's husband just passed away and to get things ready she went to the place that sells and engraves tombstones... When she got there, she ordered the most expensive tombstone she could afford. They were married 65 years after all and; had 6 children, made lots of money, traveled many places, made lots of memories, and loved each other very much of course. When paying for the tombstone, they asked what she would like engraved in the stone. To which she replied, "To my dearest husband, you were my love and my life. I cannot wait to see you again one day. Rest In Peace" as it was a common and courteous thing. Later that day she went to find out what she would get of her husbands remaining possessions, as it turns out, he didn't leave her a thing, nothing. Not one item, not one car, not one penny. The elderly lady was so furious. How could she not get anything after all they have been through? She knew her husband was tight with his money but this had to be a mistake. Going over the papers for a second, third, and fourth time it stayed the same. Nothing for the lady. So the following day she goes back to the place she ordered the tombstone and said to the man running it, "I would like something added to my late husbands tombstone. You can keep everything I had on it. Especially the, 'Rest in Peace' , but I want you to add 'Until I Get There'." EDIT: Formatting and Spelling

Wrestling Match A Ukrainian and a Newfoundland wrestler were set to square off for the Olympic Gold medal. Before the final match, the Newfie wrestler's trainer came to him and said, "Now, don't forget all the research we've done on this Ukie. He's never lost a match, because of this pretzel hold he has. So, whatever you do, do not let him get you in that hold!! If he does, you're finished !!" The Newfie nodded in acknowledgment........ As the match started, the Newfie and the Ukrainian circled each other several times, looking for an opening. All of a sudden, the Ukie lunged forward,......... grabbing the Newfie and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold. A sigh of disappointment arose from the crowd and the trainer buried his face in his hands, for he knew all was lost. He couldn't bare to watch the inevitable happen..... Suddenly, there was a scream, then a cheer from the crowd and the trainer raised his eyes just in time to watch the Ukrainian go flying up in the air. His back hit the mat with a thud and the Newfoundlander collapsed on top of him, making the pin and winning the match. The trainer was astounded !!.......... When he finally got his wrestler alone, he asked: "How the hell did you ever get out of that hold?? No one has ever done it before!!...." The wrestler answered: "Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of testicles, right in front of my face. I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could !!" The trainer exclaimed: "So, THAT'S what finished him off !!...." "Not really"............. replied the Newfie....... . . . . . . . . . . . . "You'd be amazed how strong you get, when you bite your own nuts !!"...

A woman pregnant with triplets catches three stray bullets from a drive-by shooting. In the emergency room, a doctor tells her she and her unborn children will be fine but they could not remove the bullets. He informs her all is well and the children, two girls and a boy, will pee the bullets out in around 16 years. So around the 16th year, the mother is in the kitchen making her morning coffee when one her daughters runs in, frantic and concerned. "Mom! Mom! I was peeing and a bullet came out!" Her mother tells her there's nothing to worry about and tells her the story. Then around noon, the mother is in the garden watering some flowers when the other daughter comes outside and says "Mom! Mom! I was peeing and a bullet came out!" The mother explains everything and goes back to watering. That night the mother was laying in bed reading when her son burst into her room. "Mom! Mom! I was-" "Let me guess, you were peeing and a bullet came out?" "No, no!" says the son, "I was jacking off and I shot the dog!"

An orphan had a rough year... He had been adopted three times. The first family had a dog that the boy loved, but the father beat the dog daily. The boy reported the family, and he returned to the foster home. The second family had a loving mother that took care of the boy, but the father beat his wife daily. The boy reported the father, and the mother was forced to return the boy to the foster home. The third family seemed very nice at first, but when the father got drunk, he beat the boy. Yet again, the boy reported the father, and returned to the foster home. At this point, the boy was feeling like he would never find a home he could stay in. But a local judge, hearing his story, wanted to give the boy a Christmas present. He visited the boy, and asked what he wanted for Christmas. The boy said, "I want to be adopted by the Houston Texans." Confused, the judge asks the boy why he would want to be adopted by a sports team. The boy smiles and yells, "Cause they don't beat anybody." [Insert the listener's favorite sports team for bonus laughs]

I went to a high school with a set of Chinese twins... In high school, I was in class with a set of Chinese twins named Ving and Ling. Me and Ving got along pretty well, she'd help me with my trig and I'd help her with English. One day she asked me for help on changing her name. She didn't like the name Ving because it was too stereotypical. I would probably change my name too. She wanted to change her name to Lee, like Bruce Lee. Ling heard of this plan, and told Ving that her name was passed down for generations and that his parents would disown her. Ving didn't give a shit. I drove Ving down to the town hall, and Ling tagged along. Ving goes to the desk and asks for a form and pulls out her birth certificate. I was surprised that she was really going to change her name. As she starts filling out the forms, she started to cry because of ancestral spirits and shit. She decides she didn't want to change her name. The lady at the desk says that there is a fee to cancel the name change (stupid-ass small-town laws). Ving tells Ling to pay for the fee since Ving didn't have money. As Ling was about to pay, she was interrupted by her father. Their Dad runs up to Ving and says "Don't stop, be Lee, Ving. Hold on to the fee, Ling."

He flew through the night cursing and wailing, "Merry Christmas to all and to all one hell of a night!"

I'm not gonna call on you anymore." So the teacher goes through most of the alphabet, ignoring Johnny and calling on everyone else. She then gets to the letter 'R' and can't think of a word too terrible that starts with it, so she reluctantly calls on Johnny. "RAT!" "yes Johnny, very goo-" "A BIG FUCKIN RAT! WITH A 12" COCK!"

A man walks into a pet store. The man says he wants to buy a parrot, and the owner says, "I've got the perfect pet right here. This parrot isn't expensive, and he's guaranteed to talk. Guaranteed. You can't lose." So the man buys the parrot, a cage, and a cover. A week later the man returns to the store and says, "That parrot you sold me doesn't talk. Not a word." The owner says, "Now let me get this straight. You took the bird home, took off the cover, he walks up the little gold ladder and he doesn't talk?" "What little gold ladder?" "You don't have the little gold ladder? You have to have the gold ladder. It's $25." "Oh. Well, OK." The man buys the ladder and goes home. He's back a week later with the same complaint. The owner says," Now let me get this straight. You took him home, took off the cover, he walks up the little gold ladder, looks in the little gold mirror, and he doesn't talk?" "What little gold mirror?" "Oh, you don't have the little gold mirror. You have to. It's $25." "Oh. OK." And the man buys the mirror and goes home. The man comes back a week later - the parrot still doesn't talk. The owner says, "Now let me get this straight. You took him home, took off the cover, he walks up the little gold ladder, he looks at himself in the little gold mirror, rings the little gold bell-" "Here's $25, give me the damn bell." And he storms out. He's back the next week. "That parrot you sold me died." "He did? I'm really sorry to hear that...... Tell me, did he ever talk?" "Well, once near the end ... he looked up at me and he said, "Food...."
Why some put angels as Christmas tree toppers. One year, Santa procrastinated too much and had an hour to go over his naughty nice list. He was in a cabin gaining some progress when he heard a knock on his door. "Santa, we need your help in the workshop!" Frustrated, Santa yelled "I'm busy right now, handle it yourselves. I can't afford to be interrupted!" And slammed the door. Not 15 minutes later another knock is heard and his agitation is climbing. He opens the door and yells "What?!" It was Mrs. Claus and she said startled "I brought you some food." His face tuning red, he says "I've got a half hour left to check this list, I can't be interrupted!" He then slammed the door on his wife. He then says "I swear, the next interruption I get I'll just lose it." About 20 minutes passed when he heard a knock at the door. He stormed to the door with a burning hatred when he opened it. It was an angel holding a Christmas tree. "Hey Santa, where do you want the tree?"

Being a mascot... At the age of 17, I attended high school. Our school's mascot was the lion, and the rival's was a tiger. I was the guy in the lion suit. One day at a game against my school's rival, I was doing the typical cheering on the team and keeping the crowd happy. Me and the other mascot would have small playful battles, like exchanging tricks. I was so much better. Tiger became angry. At halftime, the tiger challenged me to a plastic sword fight, and I obviously accepted. It starts and we exchange hits, hurting a bit. I was winning, when the Tiger got really mad and threw his sword down and starts punching me hard. I back off, pissed, not wanting to continue the fight. The Tiger mask was staring at me with it's smug tiger eyes, and I became mad. The Tiger waves his arms at the crowd, and gets applause. His back is towards me, and I rush towards him. I plunge my hand into his mask and rip out one of the Tiger's eyes. He was scared. I knocked him down and jumped on top of the tiger. I beat the shit out of him, probably broke his nose. A ref pulls me off and takes me to my coach. My coach says "What made you do that?" I sat there for a second thinking and eventually I say, "It was the eye of the tiger, it was the thrill of the fight, standing up to the challenge of our rivals."
My favorite Christmas joke A few days before Christmas, a man enters a pet store looking for a unique gift for his wife. The store manager tells him he has just what he's looking for! A beautiful parrot named Chet that sings Christmas carols. He brings the husband over to a colorful but quiet bird. The man agrees that Chet certainly is pretty, but he doesn't seem to be much for singing. The manager tells him to watch as he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter. The manager then clicks the lighter and holds it under Chet's left foot. Immediately Chet starts singing; "Silent Night, Holy Night." The husband is very impressed with Chet's singing abilities and watches as the manager moves the lighter underneath Chet's right foot. Chet now starts to sing "Jingle Bells, Jingle All the Way." The husband says Chet is perfect and that he'll take him. He rushes home to his wife and insists upon giving her this wonderful gift immediately. He presents Chet and starts to explain the parrot's special talent. Demonstrating, he holds a lighter under Chet's left foot and the bird sings "Silent Night." He then moves the lighter under the right foot and Chet lets loose a round of "Jingle Bells." The wife is absolutely impressed, and with a mischievous grin asks her husband what happens if he holds the lighter between Chet's legs instead. Curious the husband moves the lighter between the bird's legs, and the bird begins to sing "Chet's nuts Roasting on an Open Fire!"

"Try it out," the husband exclaims. The wife looks in the mirror and says, "Mirror, mirror on the door. Give me boobs that touch the floor." All of a sudden, the womens breast enlarge, become voluptuous, and are so big they are touching the floor. The husband obviously excited wants to try it out. He looks in the mirror and says, "Mirror, mirror, on the door, make my dick touch the floor." All of sudden, the mans legs fall off.

The man who loved tractors (Loooong joke) There once was a man who loved tractors, I mean he absolutely LOVED them. He had tractor models, tractor wallpaper, remote control miniature tractors, tractor board games, even some tractor porn(which is not easy to find mind you). The only thing that even came close to his love for tractors, was the love he felt for his wife. His high school sweetheart, who didn't mind his infatuation with tractors one bit. She didn't even mind the role play where she would dress as a tractor, he would dress as a farmer, and he would take her for a "ride". Sadly his wife was struck one day, a tractor fell off the back of a transport truck. She didn't die until he was at her side in the hospital. Her dying words "don't blame the tractor honey" and with that she headed to the big farm in the sky. Sadly, he did blame the tractor, he hated them now with all his mind, body, and soul. He went home and destroyed ALL his tractor related items, the toys, his wifes tractor suit, and even his collection of tractor porn. He put it all in a pile and burned it in the yard. What ever didn't burn enough to his liking was thrown into a woodchipper. He then went inside, rarely leaving his home, for 8 years. Finally on the 8th anniversary of his darling wifes death he decided it was time to get back out in the dating world, plus the cute cashier at the grocery store had been asking him out for a while now, he called her out to dinner. The restaurant he choose ended up being quite nice, good food, good service, great decor. But there was one problem, it was EXTREMELY smoky. So smoky that his date, being an asthmatic, was having some trouble breathing. After noticing her displeasure, and trouble breathing, he started breathing in. I mean REALLY breathing in. Inhaling with such force that all the smoke quickly left the dining room, and went into his lungs. When the room was void of smoke he stepped outside and released it all into the night. When he rejoined his date she asked "how on earth did you do that?" to which he replied, "I'm an extractor fan."

World's Funniest Joke The "world's funniest joke" is a term used by Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire in 2002 to summarize one of the results of his research. For his experiment, named LaughLab, he created a website where people could rate and submit jokes. Purposes of the research included discovering the joke that had the widest appeal and understanding among different cultures, demographics and countries. The History Channel eventually hosted a special on the subject. The winning joke, which was later found to be based on a 1951 Goon Show sketch by Spike Milligan,was submitted by Gurpal Gosal of Manchester: *Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy whips out his phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps, "My friend is dead! What can I do?" The operator says "Calm down. I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead." There is a silence, then a gun shot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says "OK, now what?"*

The Shoemaker When my grandma lost mobility, I would drop by more and more frequently to run errands and do chores for her. Drop off the dry cleaning, rake the front lawn, that kind of stuff. Well, I was cleaning out her attic for her one day and I found this old army uniform and took it down, I said hey grandma, what's the story of this? It turns out, it's my grandad's old army uniform. Yeah, no fooling. My grandad, who'd been dead for years, no shit. Well, I started going through the pockets - I didn't know what else to do with the thing, so I just started going through pockets - and there was this old, yellowed, crumbled, torn piece of paper in there, just barely legible if you looked at it hard enough. My grandma asked me what it was, but I told her it was nothing. It was actually a paper from a shoemaker my grandad would go. My pop told me about it a few times. I didn't know if they were still around, or if they were still in business, but I swung by the address my pop gave me, and they were, and this man (old as Methuselah, I swear) walks up to the register. I didn't tell him about my grandad's uniform or the history of the paper I had in my hand, I just showed it to him and he scratched himself and he grunted and shuffled to the back of the store. He comes back, he looks at me, those ancient eyes, he looks at me, and he says yeah, I got your shoes. They'll be ready next week.

"Oh...I see," says the bank manager, "and is this bitch giving you a hard time, sir?"
A reverend's wife walks into a butcher shop. She knows that her husband will be entertaining some pretty important members of their congregation for dinner, and she wants only the finest food. She asks the butcher what he would personally recommend, to which he replies "Well ma'am, I would have some Dam Ham." The reverend's wife, a simple lady, is outraged. "I am a good Christian woman," she says "and I refuse to be sworn at!" Obviously misunderstand, the butcher quickly explains himself, saying "No, ma'am, you don't understand. That's the brand name! Dam Ham. Finest around." The wife chuckles, apologizes for her reaction and brings it home. Her husband comes home from work and asks what will be for dinner. She of course tells him that they will be having Dam Ham, much to his outrage. Barely able to contain himself, he yells "We're having guests tonight and you use THAT language?". The mistake being a familiar one, she quickly laughs and explains "No, Honey, that's the brand! Dam Ham!" Seeing his error, they have a good guffaw. Soon, the guests arrive. The reverend, his wife and son are seated at one side, with their parishioners on the other. After grace, the reverend looks to his wife and courteously asks "Dear, can you pass the Dam Ham?" Their son, thrilled, immediately jumps to his feet. "Now you've got it pop! Hey, bitch, pass the fucking potatoes!"

The dumb 'pretend' game Two simple minded men are trying to amuse themselves because they are bored. One says to the other... "Oh ! I know. Let's play a game of 'Pretend' !" The other one not knowing what was the game asked what he had to do... "Simple !" said the other. "I will 'pretend' to be a Butcher in a shop and you come in as a 'pretend' customer and 'pretend' to buy something. The guy playing the customer part says "Ok, lets do this !" He turns around while the Butcher 'pretends' to be working. The customer compose himself, turn around and 'pretend' to enter the Butcher shop, and says "My good Sir, would you be so kind as to sell me 3 bottles of Coca Cola, please ?" The butcher, not pleased, explain to him that he has it all wrong. That a Butcher shop sells meats and meat products only. So the customer 'pretend' to go out and after a short while he 'pretends' to comes back in and this time he says "Hello again my Dear store owner. Would you, by any chance, have any bottles of Pepsi please ? Now the butcher is really mad and tell him to come back when he knows what he want. The customer went away wandering what was wrong. But even if he was a simple minded man he realized what he was doing wrong. So he goes back and this time he says "Good Morning to you good man ! I would like to purchase 1 whole chicken, 2 steaks and 4 sausage links !" The butcher, grinning with all his teeth is in a really good mood and chat the customer about the temperature and other stuff while 'pretending' to make the customer order. After a few minutes, he steers the customer to the cash. The customer asks "How much will it comes to for my order ?" The butcher replies "It comes to $17.54. Where are your empty bottles !"
My parents got me a fleshlight for Christmas... I don't even know how to respond to this.

They gave me the receipt in case I wanted to send it back, and that's definitely what I should do in order to discourage them from doing this weird shit in the future, but I want to open this thing and shove my dick in there so fucking bad right now you don't even understand...

Caught in the blizzard [An old one but a good one] Jack decided to go skiing with his buddy, Bob. They loaded up Jack's minivan and headed north. After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. They pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night. "I realise it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed," she explained. "I'm afraid the neighbours will *talk* if I let you stay in my house." "Don't worry," Jack said. "We'll be happy to sleep in the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light." The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night. Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way. They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing. About nine months later, Jack received a letter. Finding it hard to believe what he read, Jack decided to confront his friend. He went to find Bob and asked him, "Bob, do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski holiday up north?" "Yes, I do." "Did sneak into her house in the middle of the night and sleep with her?" "Yes," Bob said, a little embarrassed about being found out. "I have to admit that I did." "And, when she asked you your name, did you tell her my name instead of yours?" Bob's face turned red and he said, "Yeah, sorry, buddy. I'm afraid I did. Why do you ask?" "Well ... she just died and left me her 5 million dollar estate."
My grandfather told me this at dinner today (sort-of NSFW). A man walks into a restaurant in Spain... ...and he smells something delicious coming from the table to his right. He asks the waiter what the other table ordered, and the waiter replies, "ah, yes, that would be the testicle soup. Bull testicles are quite delicious." The man says, "really? I'll have one then." However, the waiter informs him that they only get one bull per day, and so he will have to wait until tomorrow. The man understands and leaves. The next day, he comes back to the restaurant early just so he can be the first customer when it opens up. He sits down, and orders the testicle soup. But when the waiter brings the soup, he sees that the testicles are much smaller than the day before. He asks the waiter, who replies, "well, sometimes the bull wins..." edit: spelling

Christmas Angel When four of Santa's elves got sick, the trainee elves did not produce toys as fast as the regular ones, and Santa began to feel the Pre-Christmas pressure. Then Mrs. Claus told Santa her Mother was coming to visit, which stressed Santa even more. When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two others had jumped the fence and were out, Heaven knows where. Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the floorboards cracked, the toy bag fell to the ground and all the toys were scattered. Frustrated, Santa went in the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum. When he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves had drunk all the cider and hidden the liquor. In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider jug, and it broke into hundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found the mice had eaten all the straw off the end of the broom. Just then the doorbell rang, and an irritated Santa marched to the door, yanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great big Christmas tree. The angel said very cheerfully, 'Merry Christmas, Santa. Isn't this a lovely day? I have a beautiful Christmas tree for you. Where would you like me to stick it?' And so began the tradition of the little angel on top of the Christmas tree.

He calls up to the man and says aloud, "I just don't understand. Why don't you want me to turn into a beautiful woman?" "Because I'm an engineer, I don't have time for girlfriends", the man says. "But a talking frog is pretty damn cool."

The poor little monkey... Three scientists were discussing what would happen if they rammed a cork up an elephant's butt and force fed it for 2 weeks. Because the experiment had never been documented and the idea was hard to comprehend, they decided to have a go. A week in, they began to realize WHY the idea had never been tried, they were stuck for someone to pull out the cork. One scientist came up with the idea of training a monkey to do the job. They spent the next week training it to pull out corks to a buzzer. The big day arrived, they set up all the monitoring equipment and set out to a safe distance. When they were all ready the first scientist pushed the button to sound the buzzer. BBBAAANNNGGG! The first scientist was covered in crap, the second scientist was covered in crap, third scientist covered in crap and laughing his ass off. "What the %$*&amp; is so funny?" asked one of the scientist. All I saw was that poor monkey trying to push the cork back in.

A circus owner and a pehlwan This was originally told to me in Urdu and I am not sure how well it will translate into English. Here goes: There was a [pehlwan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pehlwani) who was well known for eating a lot. So a circus owner got wind of him and approached him. He said 'I will get you lots of food and you can eat in all in front of the crowd. I will also give you a cut of the money earnt.'. The pehlwan agrees and on the day of the circus, he eats all of the food presented to him. The crowd loves him and the circus is a huge success. With all the money the circus owner convinces him to do another show with more food. After some convincing, the pehlwan agrees. He eats the greater amount of food given to him with ease as well, and the circus owner reaps the rewards. Seeing the opportunity to make even more money, he tries to convince the pehlwan for another show. This time, the pehlwan refuses.

Charlie the Street Car Conductor Long joke that is passed down in my family So down in New Orleans there lived a man named Charlie. Charlie ever since he was a young boy wanted to grow up to be a streer car conductor. When he finally became old enough, he applied for the job and lo and behold he got it. Now Charlie was the friendliest street conductor that the city has ever seen. Not only did he never complain about his job, but also he greeted everyone who boarded his street car and treated them like family. Everything in his life was perfect for Charlie until one day he decided to operate the street car after having a few drinks. In his drunken state, he crashed the streetcar and killed all the passengers. After going to court Charlie was sentences to death by the eletric chair. When the day came for his execution, a gaurd visited Charlie's cell and asked him what he wanted for his final meal. Charlie replied, "I want a rotten tomato and a raw fish." After Charlie finished his meal he headed into the execution room and sat down in the eletric chair. The warden gave the order to pull the switch and the room went dark as thousands of volts passed through Charlies body. After the switch was thrown back it came as a suprise that Charlie was in fact still alive. Having no idea what else to do the warden let Charlie out of jail but banned him from ever operating a streetcar in New Orleans. Since street cars were his life Charlie decided "Hey I'll go to Japan, I hear they have fancy new street cars there." In Japan Charlie gets a job as a conductor again, but as before decides that after having a few drinks that he is still able to work the street car. To no suprise Charlie crashes the stree car and kills all the passengers. Charlie again finds himself in jail ordering his last meal. "A rotten tomato and a raw fish," he tells the gaurd. After the meal was eaten, Charlie was led to the chair and once again survives the eletricity. Because he wasn't dying, he was set free but banned from operating the street cars in Japan. Charlie thought to himself, "Well I heard San Francisco still has street cars operating so I'll go there." As you can guess Charlie ends up in the same situation and again orders the same meal " A rotten tomato and a raw fish," he tells the gaurd. The warden from San Francisco had heard of Charlie and his previous death sentences so before he brought Charlie in to be executed he sent a letter to the mayor asking to reroute the city's eletricity to the jail. The mayor approved and confident with his new found power the warden smiled and gave the order to pull the switch. The lights in the room burst from the overload and the smell of something burning overwelmed the air. The warden after a minute ordered the gaurd to shut off the chair and as the smoke cleared, there was Charlie same as always. Distraught with emotion, the warden told Charlie to get out of his sights. Charlie, tired of going to jail, finally decided that maybe he shouldn't be a street car conductor after all. So Charlie travels back to New Orleans and meets his friend Thibodaux at a bar. Thibodaux after a few minutes of small talk tells Charlie "Everyone has heard about the eletric chair incidents and I just gotta axe, how were you able to survive all them jolts of electricity through your body? Was there something you did that made you resistant to it?" Charlie looks at Thibodaux and says "I dunno, I guess I was just a bad conductor."

Boudreaux's dead duck Boudreaux rushed into Doc Robicheaux's office carrying a duck. He gently placed the duck on the exam table, it lay there limp and not moving. "Doc, you gotta help my duck", Boudreaux said. Doc Robicheaux looked at the duck and shook his head. "Boudreaux, your duck is dead", he said. "Doc, you gotta do something - run some test - do something", Boudreaux demanded. "Okay", Doc Robicheaux said. The Doc whistled and a large black Labrador Retriever came in. The dog sniffed the duck from all sides, looked at the Doc, shook his head from side to side, and went back out. The Doc made a clicking sound with his tongue and a gray cat came in. The cat jumped on the table and watched the unmoving duck for a couple of minutes, turned to the Doc, shook his head from sided to side, and went back out. "Boudreaux, your duck is dead", Doc Robicheaux told Boudreaux, "Dat'll be 125 dollars". "Dat's a lot just to tell me dat my duck's dead", Boudreaux protested. "Boudreaux, I examined the duck and told you it was dead - that woulda been 10 dollars. You're da one dat demanded da Lab-Work and da Cat-Scan", Doc Robicheaux explained.
This joke made me chuckle A Chinese guy, an Italian and an Irishman arrived for their first day working on a construction site and reported to the foreman's office. The foreman pointed to a huge pile of sand and said, "I want you three guys to make a huge dent in that sandpile there!" The foreman then grabbed the Italian and said, "You are in charge of sweeping!" "OK" said the Italian. The foreman then grabbed the Irishman and said, "You are in charge of digging!" "Righto!" said the Irishman. The foreman then grabbed the Chinaman and said, "You are in charge of supplies!" "I happy for this job!" replied the Chinaman. The foreman then leaves the site and when he returned two hours later he found that the pile of sand hasn't been touched and the Italian and the Irishman are standing next to it doing nothing! "Why the fuck havn't you touched any of that sand?" screamed the foreman. The Italian stepped forward and said, "We both didn't have a broom or a shovel and you let the Chinaman be in charge of supplies, but he disappeared a couple of minutes after you left and we just can't find him!" The foreman then stormed off in search of the Chinaman but after checking the entire site he couldn't find him. Just as the foreman was about to give up looking, the Chinaman suddenly popped his head out of the sand and shouted, "Supplies!"

A hippie, a nun, and a bus driver A hippie gets onto a bus and sits next to a nun in the front seat. The hippie looks over and asks the nun if she would have sex with him. The nun, surprised by the question, politely declines and gets off at the next stop. When the bus starts again, the bus driver says to the hippie, "If you want, I can tell you how you can get that nun to have sex with you." The hippie of course says that he'd love to know, so the bus driver tells him that every Tuesday evening at midnight the nun goes to the cemetery to pray to the lord. "If you went dressed in robes and some glowing powder," says the bus driver, "You could tell her you were God and command her to have sex with you." The hippie decides to try this out. That Tuesday, he goes to the cemetery and waits for the nun. Right on schedule, the nun shows up. While she's in the middle of praying, the hippie walks out from hiding, in robes and glowing with a mask of god. "I am God, I have heard your prayers and I will answer them but you must have sex with me first," he says. The nun agrees but asks for anal sex so she might keep her virginity. The hippie agrees to this and quickly sets about having sex with the nun. After the hippie finishes, he rips off his mask and shouts out, "Ha ha, I'm the hippie! " The nun replies by whipping off her mask and shouting, "Ha ha, I'm the bus driver!"

An eccentric billionaire throws a lavish party... Please bear with me as I heard/read this one years ago so I might not recall the details correctly: An eccentric billionaire is throwing a lavish party with guests from all over the world. As the party is well under way he asks his guests to walk over to his Olympic sized swimming pool where he had it filled with all kinds of dangerous creatures, sharks, piranhas, crocodiles, you name it it is there! So he tells his guests "I will give anything to the person who is brave enough to jump in the pool and swim across!" The place falls silent as the guests only whisper amongst themselves in bewilderment. "Anything that person can dream of will be his!" the billionaire tells the guests again. Suddenly a large splash is heard and a guy is seen struggling to swim through, and miraculously he makes it across! The room erupts in cheers and the billionaire approaches the man who swam across, and tells him "I am a man of my word, and since you made it across what do you desire? Money, mansions, my daughters hand in marriage?" The man still visibly shaken and struggling to catch his breath replies "I just want to know the name of the son of a bitch who pushed me in the pool!"

A Bee and a Vagina One day a young man and woman were in their bedroom making love. All of a sudden a bumble bee entered the bedroom window. As the young lady parted her legs the bee entered her vagina. The woman started screaming "Oh my god, help me, there's a bee in my vagina!" The husband immediately took her to the local doctor and explained the situation. The doctor thought for a moment and said "Hmm, tricky situation. But I have a solution to the problem. The husband being very concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina. The doctor said "OK, what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my penis I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina. The husband nodded and gave his approval. The young lady said "Yes, Yes, whatever, just get on with it." So the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey, inserted it into the young lady's vagina. After a few gentle strokes, the doctor said, "I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper." So the doctor went deeper and deeper. After a while the doctor began shafting the young lady very hard indeed. The young lady began to quiver with excitement. She began to moan and groan aloud. The doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was enjoying himself, he then put his hands on the young lady's breasts and started making loud noises. The husband at this point suddenly became very annoyed and shouted, "Now wait a minute! What the Hell do you think you're doing?" The doctor, still concentrating, replied, "Change of plan. I'm gonna drown the bastard!"

The double flavored apple store A man just moved to a new town from far away, and one day decides to take a walk around to get to know the area. While walking down the street and checking out all the stores along the way, he notices one that seemed unusual. The sign above read "Jerry's Double Flavored Apples." Curious, the man walks inside to check it out. He walks up to the storekeeper behind the counter and he begins to ask him about his product. "I've never heard of double flavored apples, how can there be such a thing?" he asks. The storekeeper replies, "They are exactly as advertised, good sir. My specialty! Think of any combination of flavors, and we have an apple for it!" Still skeptical, the man asks for a sample. "I must try one before I can believe you" he says. The storekeeper is happy to oblige, and hands him a carefully selected apple from behind the counter. The man takes a bite. "Peaches!" he exclaims. "I definitely didn't expect that." The storekeeper then smiles and says "That's only the half of it. Now flip it over and take another bite." So the man flips it over and takes another bite, and his eyes widen. "Tastes like cream! Peaches and cream! This is brilliant! Are you telling me that every apple in this store is flavored like this?" The storekeeper is now very pleased. He hands the man another apple and tells him to take another bite. "Strawberries!" The man is now speechless. The storekeeper says "Now flip it over." "Chocolate! Chocolate covered strawberries! This is the most amazing thing ever!" The storekeeper says "We have all kinds of flavors here. Anything you want, we've got it!" Still baffled and a little unsure, the man asks "Any flavor I want? Are you certain about this?" The storekeeper confidently replies "Yessir! Anything you can think of, we've got it!" "Anything??" "Yes! Just try me." The man then thinks really hard for a moment, and comes up with something. He says "Well, there's one thing I haven't tasted in a very, very long time. I would really like to taste some good pussy again. If you can get me one that tastes like some really good pussy, I'll finally believe you." The storekeeper is now delighted, and says "Ah, sir, you're in luck! I have just the thing for you! Wait here." Then, he goes into the back room. Minutes later, he comes out with a perfectly shaped, shiny red apple. "Here," he says excitedly, "try this!" Equally delighted, the man takes the apple, and takes a large bite. He chews it slowly for a moment, but his face quickly turns sour and spits the apple out in disgust. "Shit!! This apple tastes like total shit! What the hell is this you gave me??" The storekeeper then says, "Ah, now flip it over..."

HARLEY DAVIDSON MEETS GOD The inventor of the Harley Davidson Motorcycle Corporation, Arthur Davidson, died and went to heaven. At the gates, St. Peter told Arthur, "Since you've been such a good man and your motorcycles have changed the world, your reward is you can hang out with anyone you want in Heaven." Arthur thought about it for a minute and then said, "I want to hang out with God." St. Peter took Arthur to the Throne Room, and introduced him to God. Arthur then asked God, "Hey, aren't you the inventor of woman?" God said, "Ah, yes." "Well," said Arthur, "professional to professional, you have some major design flaws in your invention: 1. There's too much inconsistency in the front-end protrusion. 2. It chatters constantly at high speeds. 3. Most of the rear ends are too soft and wobble too much. 4. The intake is placed ! way too close to the exhaust. 5. And the maintenance costs are outrageous." "Hmmmm, you may have some good points there," replied God, "hold on."

"What would you like for breakfast, sweetheart?" she asked the elder brother. "Aw hell, mom, I think I'll have some Cheerios."   THWACK "What did you say?!?"  she slapped him so hard he fell to the ground, crying hysterically.  "Go to your room, young man, you'll get no breakfast!" Still enraged, she turned toward the three year-old, "And what will YOU have for breakfast??" "I don't know, mom, but you bet your sweet ass it won't be Cheerios!"

A Buddhist monk turns to the Dalai Lama for an answer. A Buddhist monk was pondering what is the difference between a woman and a pearl, but couldn't figure it out. He gave up and decided to ask the Dalai Lama. "Hmm, interensting question, young grasshopper - said the Dalai Lama. I do not know, but if you give me three days to meditate on this, I might have something for you" Three days pass, the monk returns and gets this answer: "The difference, dear son, is that a woman threads only from the front, while a pearl threads from the front *and* from behind." The monk, a bit embarassed, says: But, Master, I know of women who thread both from the front and behind. "Ah, said the Dalai Lama, those are not women, dear pupil, but pearls." (Works better in Bulgarian, but it was worth a try. Translation suggestions welcome.)

One of them was known as Sister Mathematical (SM) , and the other one was known as Sister Logical (SL) It is getting dark and they are still far away from the convent. SM: Have you noticed that a man has been following us for the past thirty-eight and a half minutes? I wonder what he wants. SL: It's logical He wants to rape us. SM: Oh, no! At this rate he will reach us in 15 minutes at the most! What can we do? SL: The only logical thing to do of course is to walk faster. SM: It's not working. SL: Of course it's not working. The man did the only logical thing. He started to walk faster, too. SM : So, what shall we do? At this rate he will reach us in one minute. SL: The only logical thing we can do is split. You go that way and I'll go this way. He cannot follow us both. So the man decided to follow Sister Logical. Sister Mathematical arrives at the convent and is worried about what has happened to Sister Logical . Then Sister Logical arrives. SM: Sister Logical ! Thank God you are here! Tell me what happened! SL : The only logical thing happened. The man couldn't follow us both,so he followed me SM : Yes, yes! But what happened then? SL : The only logical thing happened. I started to run as fast as I could and he started to run as fast as he could. SM : And? SL : The only logical thing happened. He reached me SM : Oh, dear! What did you do? SL : The only logical thing to do. I lifted my dress up. SM : Oh, Sister! What did the man do? SL : The only logical thing to do. He pulled down his pants. SM: Oh, no! What happened then? SL : Isn't it logical, Sister? A nun with her dress up can run faster than man with his pants down.

So the Bears were looking for a new quarterback. The coach had put together the perfect team for the Chicago Bears. The only thing that was missing was a good quarterback. He had scouted all the colleges and even the Canadian and European Leagues, but he couldn't find a ringer who could ensure a Super Bowl win. Then one night while watching CNN he saw a war-zone scene in Afghanistan . In one corner of the background, he spotted a young Afghan Muslim soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand-grenade straight into a 15th story window 100 yards away. KABOOM! He threw another hand-grenade 75 yards away, right into a chimney. KA-BLOOEY! Then he threw another at a passing car going 90 mph. BULLS-EYE! "I've got to get this guy!" Coach said to himself. "He has the perfect arm!" So, he brings him to the States and teaches him the great game of football. And the Bears go on to win the Super Bowl. The young Afghan is hailed as the great hero of football, and when the coach asks him what he wants, all the young man wants is to call his mother. "Mom," he says into the phone, "I just won the Super Bowl!" "I don't want to talk to you", the old Muslim woman says."You are not my son!" "I don't think you understand, Mother," the young man pleads. "I've won the greatest sporting event in the world. I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans." "No! Let me tell you!" his mother retorts. "At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives last week, and I have to keep your sister in the house so she doesn't get raped!" The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says, "I will never forgive you for making us move to Chicago !!!!

The latest thing in the world of chickens. A guy is driving down a country road when suddenly a chicken darts into the road ahead of him. He swerves to miss it but is pretty sure he hit it. When he looks in the rearview mirror, though, he doesn't see the chicken. When he looks back forward, he sees that the chicken is running ahead of the car! Since he's doing about 40 mph, this astounds him. He decides to follow the chicken. Down the road a bit, the chicken turns down a dirt lane and then runs into a barn yard, where a farmer is scattering feed to hundreds of free-range chickens. He then notices that all of the chickens have four legs! Incredulous, he asks the farmer what the deal is with the four-legged chickens. "Well," the farmer replied, "I noticed that people really like their drumsticks and there are never enough to satisfy everyone who wants one at the dinner table. So I spent years breeding a four-legged chicken so that everyone who wants a drumstick could have one." "That's brilliant!" said the man. "What do they taste like?" "Don't know." answered the farmer. "Never been able to catch one."
Computer diagnosis One day, Pete complained to his friend, "My elbow really hurts. I guess I should see a doctor." His friend said, "Don't do that. There's a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Simply put in a sample of your urine, and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about and it will only cost you $10.00." Pete figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper which read: 1. You have tennis elbow. 2. Soak your arm in warm water, avoid heavy labor. 3. It will be better in two weeks....... That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this computer could be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the computer, poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The machine again made the usual noises, flashed its alights, and printed out the following analysis: 1. Your tap water is too hard. 2. Get a water softener. 3. Your dog has ringworm. 4. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo. 5. Your daughter is using cocaine. 6. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. 7. Your wife is pregnant ....... twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. 8. And if you don't stop masturbating, your elbow will never get better.
3 Men went to Heaven...(long) 3 men went to Heaven and God asked them, "My sons, why are you here?" The first man stepped forward and said, "God, the reason why I am here was that i was driving down Main Street on my way to work when I felt like my wife is cheating me. So I hit the next U-turn and I drove back. When I came home, I found my wife laying in the bed naked. So i flipped and started throwing things all over the house. Finally, I was so pissed that I threw the refrigerator out the window. I must've had a heart attack and died." The second man stepped up and said to the first man, "Oh, is that so! Well God, I was walking down the sidewalk minding my own business when out of nowhere a f@#$ing refrigerator fell out of an apartment window and crushed me. While the two men thought, the third man was laughing his ass off. God and the two men heard his laughing and said " What are you laughing about?" The third man replied, " I was in the refrigerator the whole time"

So I crossed off my wife's name on the form, entered my own and returned the application. I soon got a phone call from a woman saying my application had been rejected. I asked her why, and she told me the card could only be issued to the person originally solicited by the offer. However, she invited me to reapply, which I did during the same telephone call. A few days later I got another call to tell me my second application had been rejected. Why? The woman told me their files showed that I had previously applied for a card and had been denied.

Some of my favorite Scandinavian UFF DA jokes Ole and Lars were business partners and good friends. One day Lars started off for work and discovered he'd forgotten his tools. Returning home, he looked around for his wife, Lena, and finally found her in the bedroom. To his surprise, she was on the bed with no clothes on. "Vat in the vorld are you doing vidout any clothes, voman?" Lars asked. "Vell, I yust don't have any clothes to vear, dat's why," answered Lena. "Vat you talking about," said Lars as he opened the closet door and began counting: "Vun dress, two dress, tree dress, four dress... Oh, hello Ole... Five dress... ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ An elderly Norwegian named Lars decided to March to the alter at the ripe old age of 85 with a shapely miss who was only 35. His friends cautioned him about the health hazard involved, saying that the exertion of amour could prove to be fatal. "Vell, dat's the chance I'll have to take," said Lars. "If she dies...she dies." -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The nurse told Ole to strip to the waist.

The minister explained that one of the requirements was for the couples to abstain from relations three weeks prior to final approval. "When you demonstrate self control, you will be welcomed to membership in Trinity Church," explained the minister. Two of the couples indicated compliance, so the minister said, "You are now welcomed to the Church." However, Lars and Lena admitted that on the last day of the three week period, they had succumbed after Lars became aroused when his wife Lena leaned over to pick up a spool of thread that had dropped to the floor. "I'm extremely sorry," said the minister, "but I have to say that you now cannot be welcomed into the Trinity Church." "Vell," said Lars, "Ve are not velcome at Sears anymore eeder.." -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Swede: When is your birthday? Norwegian: March 21st. Swede: What year?

My boss has some winners, but I always get a chuckle from this one. (Pretty Long) A man and his dog walk into a bar, the man sits down, and his dog follows in suit. The bartender asks, "What can I get you?" The man orders a shot of whiskey and drinks it as soon as the glass hits the bar. "That'll be $3.50." the bartender says promptly. "What if I told you that my dog is able to talk? Would you let me drink for free?" The bartender quickly rebuts. "A talking dog? Sure, why not" So the man looks to his dog and asks Ol' Scruffy; "Scruffy! Tell this barkeep what keeps this bar dry during rainy days" "Ruff!" the dog says. The bartender, now frustrated, says "Ok Pal, Where's my $3.50?" The man waves him off and explains that Scruffy is merely jesting and orders another shot, which the bartender pours and watches the shot disappear. "Ok Scruffy, who is the greatest baseball player that has ever played the game?" "Ruff!" The dog replies with a wagging tail. The bartender now gets fed up with the man and his "talking" dog and throws them to the street. The man gets up, wipes his face and looks to Scruffy. Scruffy looks up and says "Well, I guess I should have said Joe DiMaggio"

Rye Bread Two old guys, one 80 and one 87, were sitting on a park bench one morning. The 87-year-old had just finished his morning jog and wasn't even short of breath. The 80-year-old was amazed at the guy's stamina and asked him what he did to have so much energy. The 87-year-old said, "Well, I eat rye bread every day. It keeps your energy level high and you'll have great stamina with the ladies." So, on the way home the 80-year-old stopped at the bakery. As he was looking around, the saleslady asked if he needed any help. He said, "Do you have any rye bread?" She said, "Yes, there's a whole shelf of it. Would you like some?" He said, "I want five loaves." She said, "My goodness, five loaves! By the time you get to the 3rd loaf, it'll be hard." He replied, "I can't believe everybody knows about this shit but me."

The Most Famous Man Who Ever Lived One day at primary school, the teacher said to the class of 5-year-olds, "I'll give 50 cents to the child who can tell me who was the most famous man who ever lived." An Irish lad put his hand up and said, "It's Bono!" The teacher said, "Sorry, Sean, that's not correct." Then a Scottish boy put up his hand and said, "It's Sean Connery!" The teacher replied, "I'm sorry, Harry, that's not right either." Finally, a little Jewish girl raised her hand and said, "It was Jesus Christ." The teacher said, "That's absolutely right, Esther. Come up here and I'll give you your 50 cents. As the teacher was giving Esther her money, she said, "You know Esther, you being Jewish, I was very surprised you said Jesus Christ." Esther replied, "I know- in my heart it's Moses, but business is business."
Winter weather emergency On a bitterly cold winter's morning a husband and wife in the back woods of Minnesota were listening to the radio during breakfast. They heard the announcer say, "We are going to have 8 to 10 inches of snow today. You must park your car on the even-numbered side of the street, so snow plows can get through conveniently". So the good wife went out and moved her car as instructed. A week later while they are eating breakfast again, the radio announcer said, "We are expecting 10 to 12 inches of snow today. You must park your car on the odd-numbered side of the street, so the snow plows can get through." The good wife went out and moved her car again. The next week they are again having breakfast when the radio announcer says, "We are expecting 12 to 14 inches of snow today. You must park..." And the power goes off. The good wife was very upset, and with a worried look on her face she said, "I don't know what to do. Which side of the street do I need to park on so the snow plows can get through?" With all the love and understanding that men who are married to blondes (and those with grey hair) always exhibit, the husband replied, "Honey, why don't you just leave it in the garage this time."
The Answer Is Four (Teacher Joke) Little Johnny was in class doing math problems when his teacher picked him to answer a question... "Johnny, if there were five birds sitting on a fence and you shot one with your gun, how many would be left?" "None," replied Johnny. "The rest would fly away." "Well, the answer is actually four," said the teacher. "But I do like the way you're thinking." Little Johnny quickly replies... "Well, I have a question for you... Say you spot three women eating ice cream cones. One is licking her cone, the second is biting her cone and the third is sucking her cone. Which one of these women is married?" "Well," says the teacher nervously, "I guess I'd say the one sucking the cone." "No," says Little Johnny. "The one with the wedding ring on her finger is married. But I like the way you're thinking."

Battle of the kingdoms There were three kingdoms, each bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knght with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor. The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious. And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.
Nobel award winning physicist and his limo driver A Nobel award winning physicist, who was afraid of flying, was on speaking tour of the nation's top colleges. He travelled by limousine to each destination to give his speech. After two dozen engagements, the physicist and the limousine driver were having dinner before the next speech. The limousine driver commented that he'd heard the speech enough times, and that even though he didn't understand it, he felt as if he could deliver it word-for-word. So the physicist agreed to trade places and let him give the speech, and the physicist would sit in the back and wear the limousine driver's uniform. After giving the speech flawlessly, the limousine driver opened the floor for questions from the students (typically there were none). However, at this particular University there was a rather egotistical student who thought he was smart enough to compete mentally with the Nobel physicist. The question took 5 minutes to get out and would require a rather lengthy explanation and some complex calculus to answer. Without batting an eye, the limousine driver responded to the young student by saying, "The answer to that question is so easy, I'll let my limousine driver, seated in the back, respond."

A particularly dirty shabby looking woman asks for couple of dollars A woman was walking down the street when she was accosted by a particularly dirty and shabby-looking homeless woman who asked her for a couple of dollars for dinner. The woman took out her wallet, extracted ten dollars and asked, "If I give you this money, will you buy some wine with it instead of dinner?" "No," I had to stop drinking years ago, the homeless woman replied. "Will you use it to go shopping instead of buying food?" the woman asked. "No," I don't waste time shopping, the homeless woman said. "I need to spend all my time trying to stay alive." "Will you spend this on a beauty salon instead of food?" the woman asked. "Are you NUTS!" replied the homeless woman. "I haven't had my hair done in 20 years!" "Well," said the woman, I'm not going to give you the money. Instead, I'm going t o take you out for dinner with my husband and myself tonight. The homeless Woman was astounded. "Won't your husband be furious with you for doing that? I know I'm dirty, and I probably smell pretty disgusting." The woman replied, "That's okay. It's important for him to see what a woman looks like after she has given up shopping, hair appointments and wine.

The Lonely Rig Worker An oil rig mechanic returns to his cabin after his shift and discovers his cabinmate sitting on the edge of his bunk, his feet in a basin, hastily scraping a razor over his soaped-up legs. "Um, hey, what are you up to?" asks the mechanic. "I was talking to old Joe in the canteen today," says his cabinmate, "and I mentioned I was feeling homesick. He told me that when he feels homesick, he shaves one of his legs before bed, and with a little imagination it feels like he's at home laying with his wife again. I thought it was a fantastic idea and ran straight back here." "I've heard of guys doing that," says the mechanic, "but why are you shaving both legs?" "Well, I'll be going home in a few days," he replies, "so tonight I'm having a threesome!"
Raisin Bread A baker hires a young female assistant who likes to wear very short skirts and a thong. One day a young man enters the store, glances at the assistant and then at the loaves of bread behind the counter. Noticing the length of her skirt and the location of the raisin bread, he has a brilliant idea. "I'd like some raisin bread please," the man says politely. The girl nods and climbs up a ladder to reach the raisin bread, which is located on the very top shelf. The young man, standing almost directly beneath her, gets an excellent view just as he planned. Once she comes down he says he should get two loaves, as he is having company for dinner. As the girl retrieves the second loaf of bread, one of the other male customers notices what is going on. Thinking quickly, he requests his own loaf of raisin bread so he can continue to enjoy the view. With each trip up the ladder, the young lady seems to catch the eye of another male customer. Pretty soon, each male customer is asking for raisin bread, just to see her climb up and down. After many trips she is tired, irritated and thinking that she is really going to have to try the bread herself. Finally, once again atop the ladder, she stops and fumes, glaring at the men standing below. She notices an elderly man standing amongst the crowd, staring up at her. Thinking to save herself a trip, she yells at the elderly man: "Is it raisin for you, too?" "No," stammers the old man: "but it's quivering a bit!"

Only in America A European Count who had a fascination with the American West, arranged for a trip to a Texas town named Outlaw. Outlaw was small but didn't know it and the town fathers were determined to impress the Count with their worldliness. They arranged to have the local orchestra perform Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at the school auditorium after the traditional rodeo and barbecue. The Count arrives and is suitably impressed. At the barbecue he completely pigs out on steak, ribs, fried okra and cornbread. He has seconds of everything and thirds of some. Afterwards, he waddles to the auditorium and settles down to an evening of great music. Unfortunately, the orchestra had been invited to the barbecue and the barbecue had kegs of beer. By show time the two bass players were completely drunk and two of the tenors from the chorus were missing completely. Undaunted, the orchestra kicked in and got through the first movement with only minor mishaps. Since the school stage was fairly small, bringing the chorus on for the second movement entailed a lot of shuffling of chairs and in the confusion the directors score was knocked off its stand. Try as they might, they couldn't get it to stay on the stand again and in desperation, they tie it on with a string. Somewhat flustered, they gamely carried on until the schools overtaxed heating system kicked into overdrive and the ceiling fans started gyrating madly with a mighty racket. The situation was practically unbearable. You could cut the tension with a knife. After all, it was the bottom of the ninth, the score was tied, the bass' were loaded with two men out, the count was full and the fans were going wild!
He's been playing. She's been played. A married man was having an affair with his secretary. One afternoon, they took off for her house where they made love for hours. Exhausted from the wild sex, they feel asleep, awakening at 8:00 P.M. As the man threw on his clothes, he told the woman to take his shoes outside and rub them through the grass and dirt. Mystified, she complied. He then slipped into his shoes and drove home. "Where have you been?" demanded his wife when he entered the house. The man replied, "Darling, I can't lie to you. I've been having an affair with my secretary and we've been having sex all afternoon and I fell asleep." The wife glanced down at his shoes and said, "You lying bastard! You've been playing golf!!"

Duct tape and Chicken wire. An old man is sitting on his front porch one morning, enjoying the weather and having a cup of coffee. Suddenly he sees a young boy walking down the road carrying several rolls of duct tape. This obviously makes him curious so he calls out, "hey son, what are you doing with all that duct tape?" The little boy replies, "I'm going to catch some ducks sir!" The old man chuckles and calls out, "son don't be silly. You can't catch ducks with duct tape!" The little boy just smiles and yells "well I'm gonna try." Several hours pass and the old man is out in his yard when the little boy walks past him dragging a whole bunch of ducks. The old man just scratches his head and go's about his business. The next morning the old man is having his morning coffee on the porch as usual and the little boy comes walking down the road. As he gets closer the old man notices he is carrying a bunch of chicken wire. He wonders what the lad is up to so he calls out "excuse me young man! What's all that chicken wire for?" The little boy calls out "I'm going to catch me some chickens!" The old man scoffs and says "son that's not what chicken wire is for! You're not gonna get any chickens with that!" The young boy happily crys out "well I'm gonna try!" Later that day the old man notices the boy walking down the road dragging several chickens. He shakes his head and says, "well I'll be damned". A few days later the old man is on his porch, having his morning coffee when the same little boy comes running down the road carrying a bundle of sticks. The old man wonders what this is all about so he calls out "hey son! What do you got there?" The little boy yells back, "pussy willows sir!" The old man stands up and says "wait up, let me grab my hat".

A chihuahua?? Two women were walking their dogs one evening when they came across a club. One woman, having never been to a club before said she wished she could go in right now except they wouldn't let her dog in. The other woman proclaimed that was nonsense and to follow her lead. She pulled a pair of dark sunglasses out of her purse and walked up to the bouncer. They bouncer explained that they don't allow pets in the club. "No, this is my seeing eye dog," she responded. "A boxer?? That's unusual." She said it was a new thing they were trying with her and then the bouncer let her in. The second woman didn't really know how to follow up with that since two blind women together trying to get into a club might be suspicious. She goes up to the bouncer anyway who tries to stop her from coming in with a pet. She also says that it's her seeing eye dog. "A chihuahua? I've never seen one as a seeing eye dog before," the bouncer says to her. She responds, "They gave me a fucking chihuahua????"

He'll be twenty-three on Monday." "F. C. Rawls, the train conductor, who has faithfully handed his wife his wage packet every month for the last 20 years, was divorced today. She found out he was paid every week." "George Mumble, the home county's most henpecked husband, died today. By the terms of his will, his ashes will be scattered all over his wife's new living room carpet." "And we shall be meeting the brilliant top civil servant who's got his ear to the ground, his nose to the grindstone, his shoulder to the wheel, his eye on the clock, his hand in the till, his back to the wall, his foot in the door and his finger on the button. And we'll be asking him how he does his flies up." "Until then, it's goodnight from me." "And it's goodnight from him."

Surprisingly, the man was so impressed with the preacher's sermon he stopped on the way out to shake his hand. "Preacher, I'll tell you, that was a DAMN fine sermon." The preacher says, "Why thank you sir, but we don't used profanity in the house of the Lord." The man says, "But preacher, seriously, I'm not a religious man, but that was the best DAMNED sermon I ever heard." The preacher says again, "Sir, while I appreciate what you're trying to say, I must be blunt: DO NOT use curse words in the Lord's house again." The man says, "Well, anyway, I was so impressed with your sermon that I placed $5000 dollars in the collection plate". "No Shit?" says the Preacher.

Sacrilegious ad-man Father Bill is down at his local pub one night when he runs into Don, an old friend from school. They start talking old times and eventually Don brings the conversation around to the fact that Bill seems to be a man of the cloth. "You see Bill, I'm actually in advertising, and I've been working on a new TV ad with, let's say, religious content. I'd be really interested in getting your feedback on it". Father Bill agrees, they swap numbers, and Don tells Bill what time and what channel the ad will premiere. Later that night, Father Bill sits down in front of the TV and turns it on, just as the advertisement is about to start. *It's evening. The camera swoops over a dusty landscape. In the distance, there's a hill, and the camera starts flying over the ground towards it. As we get closer, we see that there are wooden crosses on the hill. Men are nailed to them. The camera zooms in on one particular man - it's Jesus, the saviour, dying on the cross for our sins.* *The Camera continues to zoom in on Jesus, right up to his tortured body, follows along his arm, right up to his bleeding hand, zooms, zooms zoooooms right up to the nail that is keeping him on that cross, and there's some sort of writing on it...A C K E R T O N...* *A voice intones, in the deep, dark, baritone of God:* ***"Even then, they knew to use Ackerton Nails!"*** Naturally, Father Bill is flabbergasted and discombobulated, but after a while he calms down and calls up Don. He calmly tells his old friend that that was the most sacrilegious thing he's seen since "Two girls, 1 grail". "Yeah, yeah, I hear you, sorry 'bout that. We've had some other complaints actually", answers Don. "We've already decided to do some re-shoots tomorrow. Check it out, I think you'll be pleased - it's a lot more respectful".

Ackerton Nails!"***

Thank you After having a gaggle of children, Louise noticed her pussy was, well... kinda loose, and it was causing problems in the marital bedroom. Since she couldn't make her husband's dick bigger, she had this brilliant idea that she should undergo plastic surgery to make her pussy tighter. So she makes an appointment, bathes and shaves herself, and goes to the doctor's office. When she wakes up after the operation she finds 3 roses on her lap, and asks the nurse who they are from. The nurse beams,"Well the first rose is from the doctor. He just did that as a way of saying thank you for being his patient and for doing so well in surgery." Oh that's nice, the wife thinks, but she still wants to know about the two other roses. The nurse replies, "Well one of the roses is from your husband who so appreciates that you did this and he says he just can't wait to get you home." The wife smiles. "That's so sweet of him.... but who is the last rose from?" The nurse somewhat nervously replies, "Oh the last rose is from Bill." "Who is Bill?" asks the wife. "He's a victim in our burn unit" explains the nurse. The wife, still puzzled, asks "OK, but why did *he* give me a rose?" The nurse says, "He wanted to thank you for the new lips"

A man walks into a restaurant and sits down at a table to order. To the surprise of the waiter, he orders hundreds of dollars in food. This catches the manager's attention so he strolls over and asks the man " Just how do you plan on paying for all of this?" The customer replies " If you have a piano I will happily show you." The manager doubts that the customer could play well enough to cover the tab, but points him to a dusty piano they use to entertain the customers. To the surprise of everyone in the restaurant, the man pulls a frog out of his pocket and sets it on the keys. The frog immediately begins to play concert quality music that could almost rival Beethoven himself. The manager is dumb founded but still skeptical. He tells the customer "This is an amazing sight, but it would hardly cover the cost of your food. I'm afraid we can't fill your order" The customer looks concerned for a moment before reaching into his pocket and pulling out a small mouse. He sets the mouse on the piano where it begins to sing the most beautiful song to go along with the piano music. The manager immediately has the man's order filled and he sits down to eat. Once the meal is finished the manager, thinking quickly, tells the customer " I still feel like you owe me for the meal." The man who is angered by the display of greed turns to the manager and says " Fine! how about you just keep the mouse and I'll be on my way." The manager gladly agrees and allows the customer to leave. As he exits the restaurant, his waiter comes up and apologizes for the manager's actions and asks " Was giving away such a one of a kind mouse really worth a lunch tab?" The man simply smiles and replies " Not really. The frog is also a ventriloquist."

Machine Diagnosis One day, Pete complained to his friend, "My elbow really hurts. I guess I should see a doctor." His friend said, "Don't do that. There's a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Simply put in a sample of your urine, and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about and it will only cost you $10.00." Pete figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper which read: 1. You have tennis elbow. 2. Soak your arm in warm water, avoid heavy labor. 3. It will be better in two weeks....... That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this computer could be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the computer, poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The machine again made the usual noises, flashed its alights, and printed out the following analysis: 1. Your tap water is too hard. 2. Get a water softener. 3. Your dog has ringworm. 4. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo. 5. Your daughter is using cocaine. 6. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. 7. Your wife is pregnant ....... twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. 8. And if you don't stop masturbating, your elbow will never get better.

The pianist A restaurateur needs to do something to get his business to pick up a bit, so he decides to open a piano bar. He puts an ad in the paper for a piano player and holds an audition. Unfortunately most of the applicants really aren't that good and just as he is about to give up and go home, a young man rushes in and asks if the auditions are still open. The restaurateur figures what the heck, what's one more, so he's says wearily, "OK kid, can you play some classical music for me?" The young man sits down at the piano and plays the most beautiful classical music the restaurateur has ever heard, however he doesn't recognize the piece, so when the kid ends he says," Wow kid that was fantastic, but what is the name of that song?" The kid said,"Oh I wrote that myself. It's called *your mother's bloody tampon*." The restaurateur does a double take and says, "Excuse me?" and the kid says, "That's the name of the song: *Your mother's bloody tampon*." The restaurateur simply doesn't know what to say in response, so he asks the kid if he can play some jazz and again the kid proceeds to sit down and just blow this guy's socks off with snazziest jazz he's ever heard. But the restaurateur doesn't recognize this piece either, so when the kid finishes he says," What can I say kid? You're brilliant! But I've never heard that piece before: what's it called?" the young man smiles and says "Oh that's because I wrote that too. It's called *I'm fucking your dog*". The restaurateur says, "Look kid I want to hire you so bad, but the names of your songs, well they're atrocious. I'll hire you, but only under one condition: you can *never*, I mean *never*, tell any of the patrons at the restaurant the names of any of your songs. Do we have a deal?" The young man says, "Sure no problem." The restaurateur says, "OK then come to the restaurant at 8 pm ready to play. You'll play for 2 hours, take half hour break, and then when you comeback you just take requests until closing time." So the young man does his first shift, the crowd loves him, and after 2 hours announces, "Ladies and gentleman, I'm going to take a half hour break, and when I come back, I'll take requests for whatever you want to hear." So he goes on his break, gets a bite to eat, goes out for a smoke and then figures he better hit the can real quick before he has to go back out. He comes out of the bathroom, goes back onto the stage and announces, "OK I'm back! Does anyone have a song they'd like me to play?" A guy in the front says, "Psst. Buddy do you know your fly is open and your dick is hanging out?" The piano man beams," Know it? Heck, I wrote it!"

Bartering Australian style This morning I was in luck and was able to buy two boxes of VB beer cheap at the local supermarket. I placed the boxes on the front seat and headed back home. I stopped at a service station where a drop-dead gorgeous blonde in a short skirt was filling up her car at the next pump. She glanced at the two boxes of bevvy, bent over and leaned in my passenger window, her bra-less tits nigh on falling out her skimpy top, and said in a sexy voice, "I'm a big believer in barter, old fella. Would you be interested in trading sex for beer?" ... I thought for a few seconds and asked, "What kind of beer 'ya got?"

One of the hillbillies looks at her and says, Kin ya swallar?' The woman shakes her head no. Then he asks, 'Kin ya breathe?' The woman begins to turn blue, and shakes her head no. The hillbilly walks over to the woman, lifts up her dress, yanks down her drawers, and quickly gives her right butt cheek a lick with his tongue. The woman is so shocked that she has a violent spasm, and the obstruction flies out of her mouth.As she begins to breathe again, the Hillbilly walks slowly back to his table. His partner says, 'Ya know, I'd heerd of that there 'Hind Lick Maneuver' but I ain't niver seed nobody do it!'

One day a boy... One day a boy walked into his dads room. The dad was holding something. The little boy then asked "what is that daddy? Well that is my car. Oh ok. So the boy left. After 13 years later the boy is now 18 and his name is jimmy. So jimmy and his friends were on a cruse ship and he had his dads car and he put a wedding ring in the passenger seat of the toy. He was planning to propose to his girlfriend, Rachel. So they went to the front of the ship and where doing the titanic thing and he gave her the car with the ring in it and of course she said yes. But when she hugged him, she dropped the car on the deck and it "drove" down the deck with the couple chasing it, it rolled off the deck. So the sad couple got dinner at the fanciest restaurant and they ordered the lobster and a can of mtn dew hoping to find the car in The lobster. But no success. So exactly one month later the husband was hunting and he bagged a bear and while he was gutting it, guess what he found. The mtn dew can he threw overboard.
This one's kinda long Quasimodo is getting a little old, and he's starting to think about retiring. So he puts out an ad in the Paris Times asking for prospective bell ringers to come meet him at the cathedral for an interview. One of the first applicants is a man who doesn't have any arms. Quasi says to him, "I'm sorry, I want to give you a chance I really do, but I just can't see how you could possibly do this without arms." The man responds, "I understand where you're coming from, but please just give me one chance and I promise you won't regret it." Against his better judgement, and because it was almost nine AM anyway, Quasi allowed the man one chance. So they began the climb up the tower, and by the time they reached the top it was only a few seconds until nine. As Quasi began the countdown, he noticed the man tensing up and glaring at the bell. "3...2...1 Go now!" The man fixed his feet and charged headfirst into the bell. The resulting ring was beautiful, in fact, it sounded better than anything Quasi had done in his years at the tower. The man staggered backwards and ran at the bell again. By the time that he had struck the bell eight times, the man's nose was broken, he was swaying on his feet, and his eyes couldn't quite focus correctly. Eventually the man caught sight of the bell again and rushed at it the final time. He struck it, staggered backwards...and fell out of one of the tower's windows and down into the courtyard below. Quasi ran for the window and peered downwards, but he couldn't see anything from such a great height. Quasi rushed back down the tower hoping that the man was somehow still alive, but unfortunately when he reached the crowd of spectators gathered below, he was told that the man had died from the fall. One of the spectators asked Quasi if he knew the dead man's name, so that his family could be informed. Quasi replied, "I don't know his name, but his face sure rings a bell."
A blonde woman was speeding... A blonde woman was speeding down the road in her little red sports car and was pulled over by a female police officer, who was also a blonde. The officer asked to see the lady's driver's license. She dug through her purse and was getting progressively more agitated. "What does it look like?" she finally asked. The policewoman replied, "It's square and it has your picture on it." The driver finally found a mirror in her purse, looked at it and handed it to the policewoman. "Here it is," she said. The officer looked at the mirror, then handed it back saying, "Okay, you can go. I didn't realize you were a cop."

As he walked into his office, his secretary Anna said, "Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!" He felt a bit better knowing that at least someone remembered. In the lunch time Anna knocked on his door and said, "You know, it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your Birthday, why don't we go out for lunch, just you and me." Peter happily agreed They had their lunch but on the way back to the office, Anna said, "You know, it's such a beautiful day... We don't have to go right back to the office, do we?" Peter replied "I suppose not. What do you have in mind?" She said, "Let's go to my apartment, it's just around the corner." After arriving at her apartment, Anna said, "Boss if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back." "Ok." He nervously replied.

Bob was a carpet installer and one day he installed this beautiful wall to wall carpet for Mrs. Smith. He spent all day and did a great job. As he finished he was thinking "I'm ready for a cigarette now!". They weren't in his shirt pocket, and they weren't in his vest pocket. They weren't in his pants. As Bob was going through all his pockets thinking "crap - where the hell are they??" he looked down and notice a lump under the carpet - a single pack-sized lump in the sea of smooth white. "oh shit" he thought, and - checking left and right to make sure Mrs Smith wasn't looking, took out his large flat-head hammer, and smacked that lump down flat. So, relieved the evidence was gone and he wasn't caught, Bob went out to his truck to put his tools away - and there on the dashboard were his cigarettes! While he was pondering this mystery, Mrs. Smith came out and asked in a concerned voice, "have you seen Crackers, our parakeet? He gets out sometimes..."

The first customer into a new bar... walks over to the barman. "Jack and coke please, mate." he says. The barman, without a word, bends down and pulls an apple from the fridge, placing it on the bar in front of his customer. "Er... I asked for a Jack Daniels and coke, mate." says the guy, confused. "Just bite it." says the barman. The guy shrugs and takes a bite. Immediately his face lights up with surprise. "That's Jack alright!" he exclaims. "But where's the coke." "Turn it around." replies the barman. The customer does as he says, and sure enough, the other side of the apple tastes just like coca-cola. Ten minutes later, another customer walks in. "Vodka and Orange please." Same thing happens again. One side of the apple is Vodka, the other fresh orange juice. Word gets out about the bar and soon it's the busiest joint in town. A local tough guy hears about it and goes in, figuring to catch the new bar out. "I've heard your apples can taste like anything!" he shouts, loud enough for everyone in the now packed bar to hear him. The bar falls silent as the guy is a well known hard case. "Well... I don't know about that..." stutters the landlord. "Give me one that tastes like pussy!" Demands the tough guy. Everyone watches intently as the barman places an apple on the counter... and the guy takes a bite... "Urgh!" he says, spitting it out all over the now terrified barman. "That tastes like shit!" Everyone in the bar shouts back "Turn it around!"

"And a loving patriarch to his eight children? And the possessor of the third sweetest baritone in the state?" "Aye, oh aye," the widow sobbed. "That he was! That he was!" "But tell me true now, Kathleen," whispered her mother, in a suddenly conspiratorial tone. "Was there any substance in what I heard a few boys at the funeral whisper? That Pat was...*Ku Klux Klan?*" Kathleen, poor girl, looked up at her mother in innocent confusion. "Ku-? Mother, what does Ku Cluck Klan mean?" "Ku *Klux* Klan, daughter! It means the devil himself beneath the sheets!" Kathleen blushed violently. "Oh aye," she murmured, smiling slow. "That he was...that he was."

The Cat's Diary: Day 983 of my captivity. My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets. Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength. The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape. In an Attempt to disgust them, I once again vomit on the carpet. Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet. I had hoped this would strike fear into their hearts, since it clearly demonstrates my capabilities. However, they merely made condescending comments about what a "good little hunter" I am. Fools!  There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices tonight. I was placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the event. However, I could hear the noises and smell the food. I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of "allergies." I must learn what this means, and how to use it to my advantage. Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking. I must try this again tomorrow, but at the top of the stairs. I am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and Snitches. The dog receives special privileges. He is regularly released, and seems to be more than willing to return. He is obviously retarded. The bird must be an informant. I observe him communicate with the Guards regularly. I am certain that he reports my every move. My captors have arranged protective custody for him in an Elevated Cell, so he is safe. *For now.* EDIT: [Being on the front page! my favorite thing!](http://i.imgur.com/W9xhEqV.png)

Blondes are getting clever. A blond walks into a bank in New York City and asks for a loan. She is going on a two week long businesstip arround Europe and needs a loan on $800. The banker says that the bank needs some kind of security for the loan. The blonde hands over the keys for her brand new Mercedes, which is parked right outside of the bank. The banker says this will work just fine as security for the loan and accepts the car keys. The banker and his co-workers laughes at the blonde since she uses a brand new Mercedes Benz to about $300.000 as security for a loan on $800. The banker drives the car down into the bank's garage and parks it. Two weeks later the blond enters the bank once again and pays back the loan on $800 with interest on $5. ''The bank is very glad you wanted to take out a loan here, but we are confused'' the banker says. ''When you were gone, we did some research and found out that you are a multimillionaire. I am sure you don't need to take out a loan on $800''. The blond replies: ''Where else am I supposed to park my car in two weeks for $5?''

4 monks Years ago, there were 4 monks going through the trials to reach their inner peace. They all excelled to the point of the last test; the test of purity. Each monk had a brass ring precariously hung off their dong. Then, the head monk chose the most beautiful woman from the village to walk naked in front of all the monks. Should any of the monks be aroused, their rings would drop and they'd fail the test. The woman went down the row. Monk #1; nothing. Number 2; not a stir. The 3rd monk stood stone faced and motionless. However, when the fourth monk was reached, his ring dropped. Horribly ashamed, he bent over to pick it up. Then the 3 other rings dropped.

They all sit down and begin eating a fine meal. The woman is beginning to feel a little discomfort, thanks to her nervousness and the broccoli casserole. The gas pains are almost making her eyes water. Left with no other choice, she decides to relieve herself a bit and lets out a dainty fart. It wasn't loud,but everyone at the table heard the pouf. Before she even had a chance to be embarrassed, her boyfriend's father looked over at the dog that had been snoozing at the woman's feet and said in a rather stern voice, "Skippy!". The woman thought, "This is great!" and a big smile came across her face. A couple of minutes later, she was beginning to feel the pain again. This time, she didn't even hesitate. She let a much louder and longer fart rip. The father again looked and the dog and yelled, "Dammit Skippy!" Once again the woman smiled and thought "Yes!". A few minutes later the woman had to let another one rip. This time she didn't even think about it. She let rip a fart that rivaled a train whistle blowing! Once again, the father looked at the dog with disgust and yelled,"Dammit Skippy, get away from her before she shits on you!"

Three tired travelers stumble across a farm as it is beginning to get dark... Three tired travelers stumble across a farm as it is beginning to get dark. Exhausted, they decide to stop and ask if there is a place to sleep until morning. A friendly farmer answers the door and says they can sleep in the barn under one circumstance: Nobody is allowed to go up in the loft. The travelers say that is a simple enough request and head to the barn for some much needed sleep. After an hour of restlessness, the travelers realize they cannot find anywhere comfortable to sleep. They see up in the loft there are piles of hay which look heavenly to sleep upon. One of the men says, "I really need to sleep and there is no way he will ever know we went up there. We should just go." All three climb up into the loft and are asleep in no time. A few short hours later, they wake up with the farmer standing above them with a shotgun. He says, "I gave you one rule and you broke it. I shall kill you all now." In terror, the travelers exclaim that they will do anything for the man to make up for their actions. He says, "Fine. For me to spare you, you must go into the woods and return for more instructions with a fruit or vegetable." Relieved, the three men set out and within no time, the first traveler comes back with a peach. The farmer tells him that he must stick it up his butt without laughing. If he is able to do that, he goes free. The man begins and is quickly tickled by the peach fuzz and begins to giggle. BOOM! He is shot dead. The second traveler comes back with a single pea. He goes to the farmer and gets the same instructions. He begins and all is going well when he begins to laugh uncontrollably. BOOM! He is shot dead.

Amputee Virgin A woman had been in a car crash and the freak accident had severed all her limbs. After her stubs had healed she tried to be active with her friends and go places. One such outing involved going to the ocean so even though she could not partake in most of the activities she agreed to go. While there, her friends decided to play volleyball with a group of handsome young men. The woman laid back enjoying that her friends were having fun but it did not seem fair. Why did they get to have all the fun? She became very upset and, despite her usual calm demeanor, started to cry. One of the gorgeous men playing volleyball was taking a break and saw the woman. Taking pity on her he sat down next to her and asked, "What's wrong?" The woman explained her ails while crying even more. The man hugged her close to try and comfort her. After she settled down they sate and talked for the rest of the evening. The other girls came back around sunset, each one latched onto their new muscled friends. One of the woman's friends came up and told her she might need her own ride home since they all were getting rides back from these gentlemen. The woman started to cry once more but the man who stayed with her asked her again, "What's wrong?" She spilled her guts. She told him how all her friends had these amazing love lives and she had always wanted to save herself and now, here they were again off to get fucked. She was angry and confused and sad all at the same time. Until the man said, "I could fuck you." The woman was taken aback at first but she thought this was probably her best chance for the rest of her life. Who would want to sleep with someone who had no arms or legs? So she said yes and he picked her up in his strong arms, lifting her as if she was just a doll. He was so warm and strong. He looked deeply into her eyes and slowly tightened his muscles out of nervousness. She closed her eyes expecting those beautiful lips to touch hers. Then he threw her into the ocean and said, "Now, you're fucked."

A man goes to a cathouse with only $5 to his name. "What can $5 get me?" he asked the lady inside. "Let's see.. well, I can give you a penguin job," she replied. The call girl unzips the man's pants and leaves them around his ankles, and goes to work with her mouth. "Oh wow, this is fantastic, you sure know what you're doing!" The man was really enjoying his $5 penguin job. It was only a short while before the climactic finish was approaching, and he made no delay with vocalizing this. "I'm going to come, I'm going to come!" The courtesan quickly stopped, got to her feet, and walked out the door of the room they were in. "Wait baby, wait, wait! Where are you going?!" The man, pants still down around his ankles, waddled after the woman as fast as he could. "That's a penguin job, and that'll be $5," she said, with a laugh.

Another penguin joke This was my grandpa's favorite joke, I had to share it here. A penguin was driving down a desert freeway during a very hot summer. The penguin didn't mind the heat outside, because it had fantastic air conditioning in its car. ...until its car broke down. Luckily, there was a payphone within walking distance and the penguin was towed to the nearest roadside gas station/auto repair shop/convenience store. In the auto repair shop, the mechanic popped the hood and told the penguin that they'd call the penguin back once the mechanic could figure out what the problem was. The penguin walked into the convenience store to try and escape the heat. Unfortunately for the penguin, the store air conditioning was not nearly cool enough to keep the penguin comfortable. The penguin frantically searched for anything that could provide relief. Down one of the few isles available, the penguin found a freezer section with a couple tubs of vanilla ice cream. The penguin bought one and buried its head into the cold, refreshing ice cream. A few moments later, the penguin heard an announcement over the store intercom instructing the penguin to return back to the auto repair shop. The penguin pulled its head out of the vanilla ice cream and waddled into the repair shop. The mechanic looked up at the penguin as it approached and said, "Welp, it looks like ya blew a seal." The penguin replied, "Oh no, this is just vanilla ice cream."

"Hey, wanna play a game?" A blonde and a lawyer find themselves sitting next to each other on airplane. As take-off begins the lawyer already finds himself getting bored, and so he turns to the blonde and says "Hey, wanna play a game?" Slightly interested, the blonde turns back to him and says "What is it?" "Well, the way it works is that if I ask you a question and you don't know the answer to it you pay me 5 dollars. But if you ask me a question and I don't know the answer I'll pay YOU 5 dollars." "Nope, not interested." "Okay hang on," says the lawyer, confident in his intelligence. "Tell you what, if you ask me a question and I can't answer it I'll give you a hundred dollars instead. How does that sound?" Now much more interested the blonde nods agreeably. "First question," says the lawyer. "What is the chemical symbol of gold?" The blonde wracks her brains but just can't remember and hands him five dollars. "My turn!" she says. "What has silver and red stripes with 16 legs and wings?" The lawyer's quite confused by this, but he desperately tries to think of all the zoology he knows. He even makes surreptitious google searches on his phone. But try as he might he still can't find the answer. Finally he gives up and hands the blonde a hundred dollar bill. "But I have to know," he asks, "what was the answer to your question?" Without a word the blonde slips him another five dollars.
Herschel the Magnificent Jew A sign at the theatre says: "Tonight, Herschel the Magnificent Jew - 8 o' clock". So the fella decides to go take in the show. At 8 o' clock, Herschel comes out in a dressing gown, takes it off and he is stark naked from head to foot. In between his legs is the biggest member you have ever seen. Herschel walks over to a table where there are 3 walnuts. He takes his member and he smashes each one in turn, to smithereens! The crowd go wild. 20 years later the fella is in the same city and he sees the same theatre and unbelievably, the same sign: "Tonight, Herschel the Magnificent Jew - 8 o' clock". So he decides he must see this again to see if it is really the same thing he saw 20 years ago. Sure enough, at 8 o' clock, Herschel comes out in a dressing gown, takes it off and he is stark naked from head to foot. In between his legs he still has the biggest member you have ever seen. Herschel walks over to a table where there are 3 coconuts. He takes his member and he smashes each one in turn, to smithereens! The crowd go wild again. Of course, the fella decides he must see Herschel after the show and when he meets him he says "Herschel, 20 years ago, I saw your act. It was amazing but it was with walnuts. 20 years on, it's coconuts; what changed?" and Herschel says... "My eyes aren't as good as they used to be!" _______________ *(from Old Jews Telling Jokes)*

A blonde was fed up with all the jokes being made about her... A ventriloquist was at a local bar. With the dummy on his knee, he was going through his normal jokes, many of which included "Dumb Blonde" jokes. After many of these jokes, a blonde in the crowd stood up and started yelling at the ventriloquist. "I AM SO TIRED OF YOU AND YOUR STUPID JOKES MAKING FUN OF BLONDES!" She was extremely angry. The man, fairly startled, began to apologize, when the blonde cut him off. "You stay out of this, mister, I'm talking to that little jerk on your knee!"

The man looks at the bartender oddly, but the bartender urges him to eat it. The man takes a bite out of the apple and says "Wow, this tastes like Coke!" The Bartender says, "Turn it around." The man does as instructed, takes a bite and says "Wow, this tastes like Rum!" Another man walks into the bar and asks for a Screwdriver. The bartender gives him an apple. The man looks at the apple weird, but this time the first guy urges him to try it. He takes a bite and says, "Woah, this tastes like orange juice!" The bartender says, "Turn it around." He does as instructed, and exclaims, "WOAH, this has vodka in it," and the two men et their apples in awe. A third guy walks into the bar, and as he begins to order, he is stopped by two drunks eating apples. The first man tells him "WHATEVER you order...this guy will give you an apple....and it will taste EXACTLY how you want it." The third guy thinks for a moment and says, "Very well. I want some pussy." The bartender smiles and hands him an apple. The guy takes a bite out of it and says, "This tastes like shit." "Turn it around."

The Wise Pastor My father told me this joke while we were at a lunch, definitely worth a chuckle. There was a pastor of a very popular church in the south, and the church became so popular that eventually the pastor had to start turning new members away because there simply wasn't enough room. To make things fair, he would require all newcomers to prove their worthiness by a trial. There were three couples who wanted to join his church: an elderly couple, a middle-aged couple, and a new couple still in their early twenties. The pastor met with them and explained the trial they would need to pass in order to join his congregation. "I've spoken with you before today, and I know that you're all married couples interested in joining my church. Well, to join the church is to give up sin, which takes willpower. This trial is a test of your willpower: all of you must abstain from any sexual conduct for an entire month. Once the month is over, we'll meet again and discuss how we did." The three couples all agreed, and after a month they all met up again. "How did you fare?" The pastor asked. The elderly couple responded first. "It wasn't really too difficult for us, it was business as usual for the most part. After the month was over, we did have a nice romantic evening together though." "Welcome to the congregation, good children," the pastor said, and wished them on their way, saying that he'd see them at the next service. He then turned to the middle-aged couple: "How about you, my children?" "Well father, it was difficult, there were a couple days during the month that we didn't think we could resist, but we persevered and were able to make it through the month as required." "Wonderful, wonderful! I'll be seeing you at the next service as well. What about the two of you," he said to the young couple. "To be honest father, we couldn't make it through the month. We did make it about 2 weeks without any sexual encounters, but I saw my love bend over and pick up an orange off the floor and it got me so excited that we made passionate love right on the spot." "I can understand, you're two people very much in love, and you are married so there is no sin. However, I'm afraid that you cannot be welcomed in to the congregation, as you have failed the test." "That's OK Father, we're no longer welcome in the local grocery store either."

Where does babies come from? [Slightly NSFW] A young mother was pregnant for the second time and her little daughter wondered how she got pregnant (the basics of getting pregnant). The mother explained that a baby grows in the mothers tummy and that it all started with one egg and one spremcell, or semen. Dad has the semen and mom has the egg. Then the little girl asked: ''If you need semen and eggs to make a baby, and the egg is already in your tummy, how do you get the semen? Do you swallow it?'' The mother replied: ''Only if I want diamonds.''

Montana Grizzly Bear Notice In light of the rising frequency of human/grizzly bear conflicts, the Montana Department of Fish and Game is advising hikers, hunters, and fishermen to take extra precautions and keep alert for bears while in the field. We advise that outdoorsmen wear noisy little bells on their clothing so as not to startle the bears that aren't expecting them. We also advise outdoorsmen to carry pepper spray with them in case of an encounter with a bear. It is also a good idea to watch out for fresh signs of bear activity. Outdoorsmen should recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear poop. Black bear poop is smaller and contains a lot of berry seeds and squirrel fur. Grizzly bear poop has little bells in it and smells like pepper spray.
An old lady was walking down the street dragging two large plastic garbage bags behind her... ..One of the bags was ripped and every once in a while a $20 bill fell out onto the sidewalk. Noticing this, a policeman stopped her, and said, "Ma'am, there are $20 bills falling out of that bag." "Oh, really? Darn it!" said the little old lady. "I'd better go back and see if I can find them. Thanks for telling me, officer. "Well, now, not so fast," said the cop."Where did you get all that money? You didn't steal it, did you?" "Oh, no, no", said the old lady. "You see, my backyard is next to a Golf course. A lot of Golfers come and pee through a knothole in my fence, right into my flower garden. It used to really tick me off. Kills the flowers, you know. Then I thought, 'why not make the best of it? So, now, I stand behind the fence by the knothole, real quiet, with my hedge clippers. Every time some guy sticks his thing through my fence, I surprise him, grab hold of it, and say, 'OK, buddy! Give me $20, or off it comes.' "That seems only fair," said the cop, laughing. "OK. Good luck! Oh, by the way, what's in the other bag?" "Not everybody pays."

Chili Cook Off {this TRULY should be a repost, but if not, enjoy...} Notes From An Inexperienced Chili Taster Named FRANK, who was visiting Texas from the East Coast: "Recently I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted. Here are the scorecards from the event: **Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili** JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick. JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild. FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy. **Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili** JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang. JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously. FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face. **Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili** JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans. JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers. FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now, get me more beer before I ignite. The Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all the beer. **Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic** JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing. JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili. FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it, is it possible to burn-out taste buds? Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb. bitch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear waste I'm eating. Is chili an aphrodisiac? **Chili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover** JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive. JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement. FRANK: My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off? It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks! **Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety** JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers. JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb. FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I shit myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally, she must be kinkier than I thought. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone! **Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili** JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers. JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably. FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach. **Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili** JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence. JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number 3 passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank, wonder how he'd have reacted to a really hot chili? FRANK: --------------(editor's note: Judge #3 was unable to report)

X-Post from /r/Standup: If I ever got on stage I'd give my version of the Teletubbies... Here's my skit on the Teletubbies. So I hate the Teletubbies. It's one of the most mindless children's shows I've ever seen. I sometimes had to watch it because my ex's nephew loved the show and when we baby sat him that's all he wanted to watch. To me all it is, is a bunch of weird looking giant different colored babies dancing around on an acid trip, with dumb shapes on their heads. How is this informative? I say we do "Teletubbies: History of World War II" and give a little history lesson right? The show opens with the first Teletubbie walkin out. He's Japan. And he's yellow. And he's dancin. And on top of his head is a little airplane flying downward. The next Teletubbie walks out and he's Russia, so he's red. And on top of his head is a little sickle and hammer. Now the third Teletubbie comes out dancing and he's Germany. We'll just make him green. And on top of his head is a little statue of himself with a tiny mustache pointing somewhere. Now the fourth Teletubbie walks out and he's blue. He's Great Britain. He has a little tea cup on his head. The fifth Teletubbie comes out and he's just brown. He sits in the corner and smokes a cigarette and does nothing. After all the Teletubbies are done dancing he says how much he danced and all the other Teletubbies call him out on his bullshit. He's France. At the end of the show while all the other Teletubbies are dancing a red, white, and blue Teletubbie rushes on to stage with a mushroom cloud on his head. He flips off the yellow Teletubbie. Spins around and it says "Game Over. We win." on his ass. I don't mean this to be offensive to any country or it's history. Just something I loosely came up with as a skit.
Ladies night out... So, two ladies ditch their husbands for a ladies night out on a Friday night and they go do whatever middle-aged women think is cool to do on a Friday night. One thing leads to another and these two ladies have drunk a little bit too much and decide to head home and sleep it off. So they're driving home and on the way they realize they have to pee... bad. They try to hold it, but when you gotta go you... (you get it). Finally, they just can't take it anymore and they pull over to the side of the road near a cemetery and decide to drop their underwear and just go. One lady simply take off her underwear and wipe with those, but the other remembers that hers are a gift from her husband. However, she spotted a wreath that was on a grave and proceeded to wipe herself with it. After finishing, they went home. That weekends their husbands were at the pub chatting and one says, "These ladies nights out are getting out of hand they really need to stop, last night my wife cam home with out any panties on."

I was standing at an intersection... waiting on traffic to change so I could cross. While I waited a blind man also stopped at the corner with his service dog. While we stood waiting I noticed the dog lift his leg and pee on the man's pants leg. Once the dog was done the man reached into his pocket and pulled out a treat and offer it to the dog. I was startled and had to tell him, "Sir, I just wanted you to know that your animal just pee'd on your leg." "Yes, I know. I'm used to it," he replied. "Then why do you reward him with a treat afterwards?" "It isn't a treat. I'm trying to find his head so I can kick him in the ass."
Jimbo and Jon, two cowboys see a wanted poster for Indian scalps... The poster says there will be a fifty dollar reward for each scalp brought back. So Jimbo and Jon decide to try and make some money. They get supplies together and head straight into Apache territory hoping to find a couple unsuspecting Indians. The first day they manage to sneak up on one and get his scalp, but they figure that fifty dollars isn't a good enough payout and so they set up camp in a valley for the night with the hopes of getting more the next day. The next morning Jimbo wakes up early and starts cooking some breakfast on the campfire when suddenly all around the whole ridge around their valley campsite hundreds of angry Apache Indians appear holding their spears and bows staring at the Jimbo like death. Jimbo's eyes go wide and he darts into the tent "Jon! Jon! Wake up!" He yells, shaking Jon awake. "We're gonna be RICH!"

I visited a friend and fellow gun enthusiast recently... He took me back to his garage workshop to see a few of his guns. He was telling me about a particular gun I was holding and said to be careful, it was ready to shoot. While inspecting it, I noticed there was a small penis engraved on the slide. I asked my friend, and he said that he keeps all his guns that way. "Somebody on the internet told me to do this. It's important that all my guns are kekpt in a state of readiness. Of course, I can reverse it whenever I want", he said, picking up a wire brush. "This is my de-cocking tool." Edit: for funny

So some helium walk into a bar. Or, rather than walks, floats; for helium, at room temperature, is a gas, and thus has no legs with which to walk, and, due to its lighter-than-air nature, does not sink to the ground. The bartender himself is confused, for not only is helium invisible to the naked eye in the absence of another object to contain it, should quickly dissipate. Furthermore, a cloud of helium, lacking any sort of motor system, is at the mercy of atmospheric currents and cannot enter a bar under its own power. It should not have been capable of opening the door to the bar. Even if it could, hypothetically, propel itself in such a manner, the lack of any semblance of a nervous system would make meaningful coordination difficult, if not impossible. And, if the cloud of helium has no nervous system, how can it think to enter a bar? How can it be self-conscious enough to know that it desires a drink? To question it is to question the nature of the self itself. What is the self? Is the self the physical body? But when the body is wounded, and, say, a limb is lost, the removed tissue is no longer considered part of the self. Is the self the consciousness? Yet nobody denies that an individual is no longer himself when he sleeps. Is the self a spiritual force, invisible and nebulous like the helium which provokes these questions? No scientific, empirical evidence of such exists; it is the domain of scholars, priests, and mortals who chase the shadows of the unknown. Who could say? It is a question that mankind has struggled to solve since the dawn of time without success. The bartender is facing an existential crisis when he recalls the bar's policy towards noble gases and his psyche is once again put at ease. "You're going to have to leave, we don't serve your kind here," he says, grunting at the mass of atoms. The helium doesn't react

We're Sergeants Now! Leroy and Jasper have been promoted from privates to sergeants. Not long after, they're out for a walk and Leroy says, "Hey, Jasper, there's the Officer's Club. Let's you and me stop in." "But we're privates," protests Jasper. "We're sergeants now," says Leroy, pulling him inside. "Now, Jasper, I'm gonna sit down and have me a drink." "But we're privates," says Jasper. "You blind?" asks Leroy, pointing at his stripes. "We're sergeants now." So they have their drink, and pretty soon a hooker comes up to Leroy. "Your cute," she says, "and I'd like to screw you, but I've got a bad case of gonorrhea." Leroy pulls his friend to the side and whispers, "Jasper, go look in the dictionary and see what 'gonorrhea' means. If it's okay, give me the okay sign." So Jasper goes to look it up, comes back, and gives Leroy the big okay sign. Three weeks later Leroy is laid up in the infirmary with a terrible case of gonorrhea. "Jasper," he says, "why'd you give me the okay?" "Well, Leroy, in the dictionary, it say gonorrhea affects only the privates. " He points to his stripes. "But, we're sergeants now."

The new store... Two Australian businessmen in Brisbane were sitting down for a break in their soon-to-be opened new store. As yet, the store wasn't ready, with no stock and only a few shelves set up. One said to the other, 'I bet any minute now some idiot tourist is going to walk by, put his face to the window, and ask what we're selling.' No sooner were the words out of his mouth when sure enough, a curious Japanese tourist walked to the window, had a peek, and in a thick Japanese accent asked, 'What you sell?' One of the men replied sarcastically, 'We're selling arseholes.' Without skipping a beat, the Japanese man said, 'You doing velly well. Only two left!'
The Amazing Human Body It takes your food seven seconds to get from your mouth to your stomach.  One human hair can support 6.6 pounds.  The average man's penis is two times the length of his thumb.  Human thighbones are stronger than concrete.  A woman's heart beats faster than a man's.  There are about one trillion bacteria on each of your feet.  Women blink twice as often as men.  The average person's skin weighs twice as much as the brain. Your body uses 300 muscles to balance itself when you are standing still.  If saliva cannot dissolve something, you cannot taste it. Women will be finished reading this by now.  Men are still busy checking their thumbs.

There was once a young couple... Once there was a young couple who were very much in love.The girl became pregnant and gave birth to their first child. It was a difficult pregnancy and there were complications and surgery was required. When it was finished and the young woman came out of the recovery room, the surgeon met with the couple. "I have some good news and some bad news," The doctor said. "The good news is that you are the parents of a seven pound baby. The bad news, I'm afraid, is that there is an abnormality. Your baby is just a head. It was born without a torso. Well the young couple was very brave, and they took their baby home and they loved it, and cared for it, and played for it. And on the baby's twelfth birthday, the doctor called and said, "I have amazing news. A torso has been found that would be a perfect match for a head. Come in immediately for it's ready for a transplant." The couple was elated, not only by the news, but that this amazing stroke of fortune should fall on their son's birthday. They ran to his room. "Son!" The father exclaimed. "We have the best birthday present a boy like you could ever dream of!" "Oh yeah?" Said the kid, looking up from the floor. "Well it better not be another fucking hat!" This was a joke told by Johnny Carson, at Reagan's Inauguration, but I don't know if he wrote it.
The Post Office I went for a job at the Royal Mail sorting office yesterday. After the interview I was given a tour of the depot. I asked the guy taking the tour "What's that machine?" "That's the Acme 3000 Auto Sorter System. It can sort 150,000 letters an hour and it's 99.5% accurate. It's controlled by 12 supercomputers, each of which is 5000 times more powerful than an average desktop PC. It has over 15,000 state-of-the-art optical location identification sensors, contains enough circuit boards to entirely cover the pitch at the new Wembley stadium and it has 200 miles of fibre-optic cable. It cost over 100 million to develop," he boasted proudly. "What happens to the letters after it's finished sorting them?" I asked. "We give them to a bloke on a push bike."

Buddy laid this one on me a while back. His acting made me believe it all the way till the punchline. Was at a party when a friend starts telling this story. You'll have to change some things around to make it work for you but it goes like this. So did you hear I got a ticket last week? I was driving down this farm road cause I thought it would be a short cut getting to my girlfriends house. Anyway it was late and the road didn't have any street lights, I didn't see this pig that was in the road and I hit it. Scared the crap out of me. I got out to see if there was any damage and to see if the pig was maybe still alive but it seemed dead. I didn't know what to do so I just sorta pulled it off to the side of the road and kept going. A few days later I got a ticket in the mail for hitting the pig. I couldn't believe it. That pig squealed on me.

I got spurred on to nerdy physics jokes a few minutes ago and remembered this one time my good friend told me about a heated sexual encounter he had once.... One evening, with his charge at full capacity, Micro Farad decided to get a cute coil to discharge him. He went to the Magnet Bar to pick up a chip called Millie Amp. He caught her out back trying self induction; fortunately, she had not damaged her solenoid. The two took off on his megacycle and rode across the Wheatstone Bridge into a magnetic field, next to a flowing current , to watch the sine waves. Micro Farad was very much stimulated by Millie's characteristic curve. Being attractive himself, he soon had her field fully excited. He set her on the ground potential, raised his frequency, lowered her resistance, and pulled out his high voltage probe. When he inserted it in parallel, he short-circuited her shunt. Fully excited, Millie cried out, "ohm, ohm, give me mho". As he increased his tube to maximum output, her coil vibrated from the current flow. It did not take long for her shunt to reach maximum heat. Now with the excessive current shortening her shunt, Micro's capacity rapidly discharged  every electron was drained off. But that was not the end of it. Indeed, they fluxed all night, tried various connections and hookings until his bar magnet weakened, and he could no longer generate enough voltage to sustain his collapsing field. With his battery fully discharged, Micro was unable to excite his tickler, so they went home. A few weeks later, they were merged forever and oscillated happily ever after. ---- [Sauce (see #13)](http://jupiterscientific.org/sciinfo/jokes/physicsjokes.html)
The Sensuous Wife! With a very seductive voice the woman asked her husband, "Have you ever seen Pound 20 all crumpled up?" "No," said her husband. She gave him a sexy little smile, unbuttoned the top 3 or 4 buttons of her blouse, and slowly reached down into the cleavage created by a soft, silky push-up bra, and pulled out a crumpled twenty pound note. He took the crumpled twenty pound note from her and smiled approvingly. She then asked him, "Have you ever seen Pound 50 all crumpled up?" "Uh... no, I haven't," he said, with an anxious tone in his voice. She gave him another sexy little smile, pulled up her skirt, and seductively reached into her tight, sheer panties... and pulled out a crumpled fifty pound note. He took the crumpled fifty pound note, and started breathing a little quicker with anticipation. "Now," she said, "have you ever seen Pound 50,000 all crumpled up?" "No way!" he said, while obviously becoming even more aroused and excited. "Well go look in the garage," she said.

Old Blind Mabel [NSFW] Richard has just finished his ten-year prison sentence and is released to the world with a new suit, a hundred dollars, and a voucher for a free cab ride. He climbs into the cab outside the prison and asks the driver to take him to the nearest whorehouse. The cabby drops him off at a non-descript building on the outskirts of town. "Ask for Old Blind Mabel." "Why do they call her Old Blind Mabel?" "Just wait; you'll see." The cabby drives off. A madam greets Richard as he walks into the building. "Can I help you, son?" "Yes, I'm looking for... Old Blind Mabel?" "Ah, yes," smiles the madam. "That will be $100." Richard is upset to be parted from his $100 so soon, but it's been a long time since he's had sex with a woman so he hands her the money. He's instructed to go to the last room on the left at the top of the stairs. As he enters the room he sees an old woman in a rocking chair. She's knitting a sweater. As she looks up, he sees that she's blind and has two glass eyes. One is looking far left; the other is looking far right. "Can I help you, sonny?" the old woman asks. "Yes, I'm looking for... Old Blind Mabel?" "Oh, that's me, sonny. Step in front of me, will you?" Richard is having second, third, and fourth thoughts at this point, but he's already spent his money so he feels committed to the act. He stands in front of Old Blind Mabel, and she unbuckles his pants and pulls them to his ankles. She then grabs his member and brings it to firmness, and pops out one of her glass eyes. "What the hell are you doing!?" Richard screams. "It's okay, sonny, I've done this thousands of times. Trust me, you won't be disappointed." With that, she slips her empty socket over the tip of his penis and proceeds to rock back and forth in her rocking chair. Richard's disgust turns to curiosity, and finally to absolute pleasure. This was the best feeling he'd ever experienced! Within a few seconds he shoots his load inside her eye. She pulls him out and grabs a tissue, and wipes the jizz from her eye. "OH MY GOD, THAT WAS FANTASTIC!" Richard gushed. "That's it, I'm coming back here as soon as I can get another hundred bucks!" Old Blind Mabel smiles and says, "I'll keep an eye out for you."
Big Chief No Fart In an ancient Indian village lived a mighty old chief. He was a gigantic man, known everywhere for his lack of the ability to fart. One day this chief rounded up all of his advisors to discuss the matter. At the meeting, one of the elder advisors said he had heard of a great medicine man who lived many moons away. And so the chief called in his closest friend to send him on a journey to talk with this medicine man. His friend agreed and was off immediately. He reached the hut of the medicine man many days later. He walked up and said, "Big chief, no fart." The medicine man looked up and said, "Mak'em eat beans for one week and come back to see me." And so the man took the advice back to the chief who, in turn, followed it. But still nothing. The man returned to the medicine man, and said: "Big chief, no fart." And so the medicine man said, "Make'em eat beans for one month, then return." So the friend of the chief returned, and the advice was taken. Still no fart. So the friend went back to the medicine man after a month and reported the same thing. "Big chief, no fart," he said. "Mak'em eat only beans for one year." And so the advice was taken back to the big chief. A year later, the medicine man was waiting for the man to return. On a sunny day he did, looking sad and dishevelled. "Son, did my advice work?" asked the medicine man. The man nodded his head yes. "So, what happened?" The medicine man looked up at the chief's friend, who responded: "Big fart, no chief."

Bowels no move An Indian named Chief Bowels lived in a teepee on the reservation. One day he received a letter from the state division of highways that said that they were going to build a freeway and it would go right through where his teepee was located and he would have to move. He was very upset about this because his ancestors had lived in that exact place for many generations. He decided to go into town to talk to someone and get them to change the route of the freeway. He arrived in town but didn't know where to go so he asked someone for directions to the local office of the highway department. He was told to go three blocks straight ahead then turn left for two blocks and it would be on the right. He went three blocks straight ahead then turned right and went into the building on the left. It was a drugstore. The druggist asked him if he could help him and the Indian replied. "Bowels no move!" "Oh," said the druggist. That's no problem. Take this twice a day for a week." he said, as he gave the Indian a bottle of medicine. The Indian left and one week later the he returned. "Hello," said the druggist. "Did that medicine work?" "Bowels still no move!" said the Indian. "Well, well," said the druggist. "It appears that we will have to use something a little stronger. Take this four times a day for a week." The Indian left and one week later he returned. "Hello again," said the druggist. "How are you doing?" "Bowels still no move!" said the Indian. "Oh my goodness!" said the druggist. "This really calls for something drastic. This is the most powerful treatment in existance. Take it eight times a day for a week." The Indian left and one week later he returned. When the druggist saw him he asked, "bowels move?" "Fine fine you win, Bowels have to move" said the Indian. "Teepee full of shit!"

Topical Jokes (1/13) Well, I'm back from a long hiatus but am excited to get back to writing some topical jokes for you all. As always, you can get more here (https://twitter.com/annoyedboyd). Let's get started! The 71st Golden Globes aired last night to big ratings. Critics agree it was all thanks to a magnificent best drama win for the hip-hop epic "8 Mile: Rick Ross's Harrowing Struggle to Complete a 13K Diabetes Fun Walk". Even more entertainment news, "Mad Men" has announced its final season air date. They even teased the series's big finale where Don Draper makes love to a sexy feral subway cat then comes up with the jingle for Meow Mix. A recent study has confirmed that the human male y-chromosome will not die off in the future despite initial worry. However, the y-chromosome will have a midlife crisis in six years during which it will insist all cell nuclei call it "Da Y-Man". In tech news, Facebook announced it will begin to kill its much-loathed news feed ads. Instead, Facebook will just force each user to take monthly drunk selfies with the Pillsbury Dough Boy. Over to the political sphere, it seems that many are now doubting Governor Christie's electability as a presidential candidate. And that's not just because of Christie's controversial business ties to Big Canola Oil. In a candid move, President Obama finally let the press photograph his lunch with Biden. The New York Times got a couple good shots of President Obama sharing a laugh with the Vice President while the Wall Street Journal snapped a few adorable pics of Biden with psketti all over his cheeks and bib. Last up, the President has announced he will be considering four NSA reforms. Three are mainly bureaucratic while the last reform is to name the NSA something less intimidating like "Obama's Cuddly Jamboree of Encrypted Email Snooper Poopers". That's it for now. I certainly hope you enjoyed them and I look forward to getting back into posting!

(Original)The Honest Chinese man A man in his early sixties visited Vietnam for his vacation. Upon clearing customs, the officer pulled him over to question him on his honesty: "Mr. Wong, upon checking your travel documents we have found a mismatch in your immigration questionnaire and your passport record. You said you have visited Vietnam once in your past but your passport shows no such record. As an officer I cannot grant you entree unless you are being honest with us." The Chinese man insisted he has told the truth and the officer had no choice but to send him home. Not giving up, the Chinese man came back two weeks later and encountered the same officer. Again he sent the Chinese back. Add two more week later the man came back! Again and again the man keep trying to enter Vietnam for the entire year of 2013 and the officer barred him over and over again until one day he gave in: "Ok Mr. Wong. It's Christmas and we all want to make things easy. You insisted you have entered Vietnam without the involvement of human trafficking, smuggling and any other illegal activities. Tell me, when and how you entered Vietnam before this and I will let you pass." To this the Chinese man replied: "40 years ago, in a tank." Trivia: The overused gag "Sum Tin Wong" as a Chinese name actually exists. Written in Chinese it is "" and his surname is actually "Sum"() not "Wong", Tin Wong means "god bless with prosperity.

The Elusive Midget Nun Two Eskimos, a big one and a little one, walk up to the convent door. The big one nudges the little one and says, "Go ahead, knock on the door, knock on the door." The Mother Superior answers the door. Again, the big Eskimo nudges the little one and says, "Go ahead, ask her the question, ask her the question." The little Eskimo timidly says, "May we speak with the midget nun that lives here please?" The Mother Superior answers, "There are no midget nuns living here." The big Eskimo starts nudging the little one again and says, "Go ahead, ask her the other question, ask her the other question." The little Eskimo asks in a quavering voice, "Well, are there any midget nuns in Alaska?" The Mother Superior responds uncertainly, "I know most of the nuns in Alaska and I don't believe so." With this the big Eskimo falls down and rolls on the ground, clutching his belly as he laughs uncontrollably. "See," he says to the little Eskimo, "I told you that you screwed a penguin!"

She said, "Because if I'm gonna have to gargle that shit, its gonna happen before sister mary sits in it!"

So the Chicago Cubs have a new mascot... ... and you can find Clark's bio [here](http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/fan_forum/clark.jsp). While it talks about Clakr's "great-grandbear Joa" it doesn't mention any of his other family members, nor the real reason why he is the new mascot. At a regular checkup, a zoo member noticed some bruises on Clark's body &amp; DCFS (Department of Children and Family Services) was called in to investigate. --- After the DCFS social worker arrived they asked if Clark's father hits him. *Yes, my dad beats often me when he is mad* - Clark responded. DCFS - *What about your mother?* Clark - *She beats me when I get in trouble.* DCFS - *Well can we send you to live with your grandparents in the north woods?* Clark - *No, they'd beat me even worse for being a city bear.* DCFS - *So who do you want to live with?* Clark - *The Chicago Cubs, because they can't beat anyone.*

Barnyard Tales A salesman gets lost in the country one night and sees he's low on gas. He sees a light on in a farmhouse and decides to stop and ask for directions. The farmer who answers the door listens to his request for directions but instead says to the salesman, "Why don't you just stop for the night and stay over? These back roads can be mighty treacherous and I'd hate to see you get stranded out here. I can put you up in my barn for the night, then in the morning you can get a nice big breakfast of flapjacks and coffee and you'll be ready to go." The salesman is so tired, he takes the farmer up on his offer and stays the night in the barn. The next morning the salesman comes to breakfast and the farmer asked him how he slept. The salesman said," I had a great night's sleep and I got to meet all the animals in the barn last night. They are so interesting!" The farmer doesn't quite know what he means by this, so the salesman explains that he has the ability to talk to animals. Sensing the farmer's disbelief, the salesman said," Well, for example, I talked to your cow. She said her name is Bessie and you come in promptly at 6AM to milk her every morning." Farmer says, "Damn that's right!" The salesman continues, "and your two pigs named Fester and Amos say you come in promptly at 6:30 every morning to give them their slop." Farmer says," Damn that's right too." Finally the salesman said, "and I talked to the sheep Mae who says you come in every morning at 7..." when the farmer interrupts him abruptly and says, "Don't believe a word those sheep say: they're nothing but a bunch of god damned liars!"

Koala says "Having a spliff man, come up and have a few puffs..." So up the lizard goes, but after a few drags he's thirsty. Koala says "No problem little dude, just little bit down the road there's a river, go have a drink."

Today, I got up early... ...put on my long johns, dressed quietly, made coffee, grabbed my clubs, slipped quietly into the garage, loaded my clubs into the car, and proceeded to back out into a torrential downpour. There was snow mixed with the rain and the wind was blowing 50 mph. I pulled back into the garage, turned on the radio, and discovered that the weather would be bad throughout the day. I went back into the house, quietly undressed, and slipped back into bed. There I cuddled up to my wife's back, now with a different anticipation, and whispered, 'The weather out there is terrible.' She sleepily replied, 'I know, can you believe my husband is out golfing in that stuff?'

How I picked my career. I was driving down the street, when I was cut off by someone. I honked frantically, applied the brakes masterfully and dodged a sure accident. At the next set of lights, I pulled up beside the perpetrators and it was a car with 4 black men in it. I gave them the finger, and they became hostile towards me. They called me a "fucking cracker" and "a stupid white boy" I told them to "learn how to drive" and " pay some fucking attention". They scoffed at me, and began to drive ahead, only to be Tboned by an on coming fire truck. Amongst our argument, the driver must not have heard the siren. I reflected on my behaviour and thought "shit, that coulda been me". So the next day I went out and became a fire fighter.
Thanks, Rodney (Assume the Dangerfield voice) "My wife and me don't get along too good, y'know? She said she was gonna cut me down to once a month. Once a month! "Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. I know two guys she cut off completely!"
As we all know, God created the world in one day Then he went on to create everything else: the vegetation, the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, the land animals, and, finally, he created the first man, Adam. And he looked over his creation and saw that it was good. Except for Adam. He saw that Adam was lonely, because of all the lifeforms God created, none were good enough to keep Adam company (bestiality wasn't invented yet). So, God came to Adam and said, "Alright Adam, I can give you a deal: I can create a partner for you that you'll absolutely love. She'll cook for you, clean for you, do your laundry, and she'll be beautiful and she'll give you the best sex you could ever imagine." Adam thinks for a second, then asks, "How much is this going to cost me?" God says, "I'm going to have to be honest with you: it's going to cost an arm and a leg." So Adam says, "What can I get for a rib?"

Thinking up a quick plan the man answers that he is indeed Jewish. The man with the gun then says "Oh, I am the luckiest Arab alive!"

Two great trees were swaying in a forest. One of the trees looks down and sees a sapling growing between them. The tree says to the other, "is that a son of a beech or a son of a birch"? Unsure of the answer, the other tree beckons a woodpecker to investigate. The bird flies down to the sapling, takes a little taste and returns to the two great trees. "Gentleman", he said, "that is neither a son of a beech nor a son of a birch. That, my friends, is the finest piece of ash I've ever had my pecker in"!
The New Electric Train A few days after Christmas, a mother was working in the kitchen listening to her young son playing with his new electric train in the living room. She heard the train stop and her son said, "All of you sons of bitches who want off, get the hell off now, cause this is the last stop! And all of you sons of bitches who are getting on, get your asses in the train, cause we're going down the tracks." The mother went nuts and told her son, "We don't use that kind of language in this house. Now I want you to go to your room and you are to stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language." Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, "All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon." She hears the little boy continue, "For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today." As the mother began to smile, the child added, "For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the bitch in the kitchen."

A man with no arms is looking for a new job in the newspaper when he comes across an ad for a Bell-Ringer at the local church. The next day we went down to the church and the doors were closed. So he banged on the door using his head to get the attention of the priest. The priest answers, "Yes sir, can I help you?" The man replies, "I'm here for the bell-ringer job posted in the newspaper." The priest looking befuddled asks, "how do you intend on ringing the bell with no arms?" The man replies, "let me worry about that." So they walk up to the top of the bell tower and the priest says, "if you can ring this bell, you can have the job." The man takes a running start and wams his head of the bell, making it ring, so the priest gives him the job. The man has to ring the bell 5 times a day, meaning he walks up 6 flights of stairs, rings the bell, and walks back down. And since he's been doing this for 6 months, his face is all messed up. This one day, he's getting his running start when he trips and falls out of the bell tower to the ground below. People start to crowd around the man and one woman says, "does anyone know who he is?" Another man picks up his head and says, "I don't know his name, but his face sure rings a bell." - my favourite joke from pee wee herman

How about some stereotyping to start off the day? An Italian, a Scotsman and a Chinese man, are hired at a Construction site. The foreman points out a huge pile of sand. He says to the Italian guy, 'You're in charge of sweeping.' To the Scotsman he says, 'You're in charge of shovelling.' And to the Chinese guy, 'You're in charge of supplies.' He then says, 'Now, I have to leave for a little while. I expect you men to make a dent in that pile of sand.' So when the foreman returns after being away for a couple of hours the pile of sand is untouched. He asks the Italian, 'Why didn't you sweep any of it?' The Italian replies, 'I no hava no broom. You saida to the Chinesea fella that he a wasa ina charge of supplies, but he hasa disappeared and I no coulda finda him nowhere.' Then the foreman turns to the Scotsman and says 'And you, I thought I told you to shovel this pile.' The Scotsman replies, 'Aye, that ye did laddie, boot ah could nae get meself a shoovel. Ye left th' Chinese gadgie in chairge of supplies, boot ah couldna fin' him neither.' The foreman is really angry now. He storms off toward the pile of sand to look for the Chinese gent. Just then, the Chinese man leaps out from behind the pile of sand and yells, 'SUPPLIES!!!!

A boy went to visit his grandfather that lived deep in the mountains... [long] He hadn't seen his grandfather in quite some time, not since his grandmother's funeral a few years back at least. So, deciding that it would do their son well to visit the old man for the summer, his parents packed him up and sent him to go stay with the old man for the summer. So, upon his arrival, the boy found his grandfather and a very large, old dog sitting on the front porch attached to a completely ancient and rickety cabin, which he was later told by his relative that it had no running water, electricity, or air conditioning and that he should 'get used to roughin it'. The old man ushered the boy inside, saying that there was dinner already cooking for him on the stove; the dog following close behind. The boy looked around, and finally he sat down to eat with his grandfather, using the dinner plates left behind by his late grandmother. The boy noticed that there were a few smudges and flecks of food still on the plate, but decided to say nothing about it and just continued to eat. The same thing happened the next day, however the food he had eaten yesterday now resided upon the plate. "Grandpa?" he asked hesitantly, looking up to the old man. "I don't think this is very clean..." The old man shrugged. "Well it's the best Cold Water can do, boy." Deciding that this was true, he said nothing, and continued to eat. The *next* night, and every night after, the same thing happened, only with the previous night's meal still half-way caked onto the plate. The boy occasionally decided to speak up, and said, "Grandpa the plate isn't clean." And, again, the old man would have just shrugged and said, "It's the best Cold Water can do boy." The boy would then huff with a bit of annoyance, and after a while of this going back and forth, he just decided that he shouldn't speak of it again if this was going to be his answer every time. One night, after dinner, the boy, his grandfather, and the dog all sat on the front porch enjoying the fireflies and the sounds of nature when the dog picked up the scent of a squirrel. Being the old hunting dog it was, he began to bark, and bark and bark and bark until the old man had enough of it and yelled, "Cold Water! Be quiet!"

One wish A man is walking down the street when he stumbles upon an old lamp. Giving it a rub a genie appears and says to him, "I will grant you one wish, what will it be?"

The genie replies "No way! Think of how much material that'd be! How about something else?" The man thinks again and comes up with another idea. "You know, I've always wanted to know how women think. What they feel and their emotions and dislikes. I wish I could understand women!" He grins and looks at the genie expectantly. "Two or four lanes?"

Deer, boar, fox, etc. When they enter the study, there stands a 6'2" stuffed grizzly bear. "Grandpa, did you kill that bear?" Billy asked. "I sure did, Billy." "That's amazing! How did you do it?!", Billy asked out of wonder. His grandpa set aside his cane and took a seat. "Let me tell you a story. I was in the woods one day, chopping a tree for firewood. Suddenly, I heard a rustle in the bushes behind me. I turn my head, and there was this grizzly bear. Staring me right in the eyes. All I had was an ax and my pistol, and well... I shit my pants." Billy is in absolute shock. "Grandpa, that sounds terrifying! I'd probably shit my pants too!" "No," grandpa says, "I mean right now. I just shit my pants."
An 80-year-old couple were having problems... ...remembering things, so they decided to go to their doctor to get checked out to make sure nothing was wrong with them.

She then says, "Well I also would like some strawberries on top. You had better write that down cause I know you'll forget that." He says, "I can remember that; you want a bowl of ice cream with strawberries." She replies, "Well, I also would like whipped cream on top. I know you will forget that so you better write it down." With irritation in his voice, he says, "I don't need to write that down! I can remember that!" He then fumes into the kitchen. After about 20 minutes, he returns from the kitchen and hands her a plate of bacon and eggs. She stares at the plate for a moment and says, "See? You forgot my toast."

Wife has hearing problems A old man thinks his wife is losing her hearing. He calls the doctor about it and the doctor says he can do a little experiment to determine the severity, "Ask her a question from the next room in a normal tone of voice, and keep asking while coming closer until she can hear you. That way you know the range of her hearing." That night, he's sitting on his easy chair in the living room while his wife is in the kitchen cooking dinner. He estimates he's about 30 feet away. In a normal tone of voice, he says, "What's for dinner?" She doesn't respond, so he gets up and walks to the kitchen doorway, about 20 feet away, and asks, "What's for dinner?" She still doesn't respond so he walks 10 feet closer and asks, "What's for dinner?" She still doesn't say anything, so he gets right up beside her and asks, "What's for dinner?" She says, "For the fourth damn time we're having chicken!"

The woman below replied, "You are in a hot air balloon hovering approximately 30 feet above the ground. You are between 40 and 41 degrees north latitude and between 59 and 60 degrees west longitude." "You must be an engineer," said the balloonist. "I am," replied the woman. "How did you know?" "Well," answered the balloonist, "everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of you, and the fact is I am still lost. Frankly, you've not been much help so far." The woman below responded, "You must be in management." "I am," replied the balloonist, "but how did you know?" "Well," said the woman, "you don't know where you are or where you are going. You have risen to where you are, due to a large quantity of hot air. You made a promise which you have no idea how to keep, and you expect people beneath you to solve your problems. The fact is you are in exactly the same position you were in before we met, but now, somehow, it's my fault!"

A 50 year old single woman goes to the doctor... She tells the Doctor that she's a virgin, and that she's never even been kissed. She's asked all her friends why she's never been approached, none of them have been able to explain it to her. She just turned 50, and she's sure it must be some sort of medical problem. The doctor says he'll do a physical, and goes through the routine. At the end, he asks her to pull her pants down, turn around, and grab her ankles. Perplexed but desperate, she obliges. "Ahh," says the doctor, "it's as I thought. You have Zachary Riker disease. Very rare." "Zachary Riker disease? What is it?" The doctor explains that he's not comfortable explaining the disease to her, as he is no expert. In fact, it's so rare, he doesn't even know of a doctor to whom he can refer the poor woman. Nonplussed but determined to discover the cause behind her virginity, the woman leaves. She looks up another doctor, visits their office, and goes through the same spiel. Same thing: physical, pants down, grab your ankles, Zachary Riker. Even more surprising, the doctor gives the same excuse and refuses to elaborate. She leaves, finds another doctor. This repeats itself at least half a dozen times until at last she finds a doctor who says he knows of the discoverer of Zachary Riker disease. Fortunately, he still has a practice. Unfortunately, he's in Japan. Undaunted, the woman flies to Japan to see this doctor who can tell her why she's never been laid. She's in the room with the doctor, tells him the same thing she's said half a dozen times. The doctor begins the physical, and like all the others says, "Prease purl your pants down, and grab your ankres." She obliges. "Ah, yes, definitery Zachary Riker." "Yes yes, I KNOW, but what *is* it?!" "Your face rook zachary riker asshole." EDIT: for clarity (and brevity, believe it or not)

A tourist in Spain... A wealthy American tourist traveling in Spain goes to a fancy restaurant and requests the most expensive item on the menu. They bring him two large round balls of a very unusual looking meat. He is pleased by the size of the portions, but is wondering what kind of meat it is and asks the waiter. The waiter explains that after a bullfight, the meat is given to various charities, but the testicles of the bull are an incredible delicacy and sold to the finest restaurants. At first he is disgusted, but very curious and not wanting to be rude he takes a bite and is amazed; they're delicious! A few days later, he decides that it was so good that he returns to the restaurant and orders the same item. "Excellent choice sir!" The waiter exclaims. But when he brings the dish to the man, the portions this time are tiny. "Wait, what?" He asks, clearly upset, "What's this?" "Well, as you can see," The waiter responds, a little embarrassed, "The bullfighter does not always win."

Restaurant got Business Consultation A client ordered a soup in a restaurant but he didn't get his spoon so he calls the waiter over. The waiter just grabs in his breast pocket and pulls out a spoon and hands it to the customer. The customer is pleasantly surprised and goes "that sure went quick, you guys always carry an extra spoon around?" The waiter goes: "Yes, you know we had business consultants from McKenzie here and they streamlined all the processes. They calculated that if every waiter always carries a spoon around this will save every waiter 18 extra walks to the kitchen a week, and for every waiter combined that amounts to over 50 hours a month which is like 500 bucks." the client is impressed. After lunch when the client is ordering the bill he notices a little thread going from the belt of the waiter into the fly. He asks "is this also something to with McKenzie"? "Yes, you know, the thread is tied to my penis and if I go to the toilet I can just open my pants and pull the thread and don't have to touch my penis - I don't have to wash my hands after peeing, save time again and McKenzie calculated that this saves the restaurant another hundreds of dollars a month". The client is impressed but asks "So how do you get it back into your pants after peeing?" Waiter: "I don't know how the others do it but I use the spoon"

When he walked back in side with a curious look on his face, his dad smiled and asked, "So Johnny, what did Santa bring you this year?" Johnny replied, "I think I got a goddamned dog but I can't find the son of a bitch."
Why Businessmen earn more than engineers ! Our mechanic's professor's reasoning of "Why businessmen earn more than engineers ! " If we equate the two variables namely into the two field's general statements, - Time is money - Knowledge is power We know, - Power = Work / Time Substitute the variables into the equation and we get, - Knowledge = Work / money Rearranging we get, - money = Work / Knowledge Proving that as Knowledge reaches 0 money reaches infinity. And so the smarter you are (engineers?) The less you earn.

An old farmer has a dimwit son and a smart son... He has to figure out which one will take over the family farm. He summons the boys and sits them down around the dinner table. He says, "Boys, I don't have much longer left and I need to decide which of you will get the farm when I pass. In order to make this decision, I will give each of you a high quality duck. Whoever gets the most for their duck will inherit our farm." Well, the smart son does what anyone would do. He heads straight to market and sells the duck for $17.50 (USD). This is top dollar for a perfect duck. He heads home confident he will win. Meanwhile, the dimwit son is walking down the road kicking rocks with the duck in his arm. As he passes a brothel a lady of the night is on the porch. "Boy, that sure is a fine duck you have their," she says. "How about we make a trade? Your duck for a fuck." The boy, without thinking agrees and they head upstairs. About an hour later he walks out buttoning his pants. She walks out breathing heavily. She says to him, "If you can fuck me like that again, I will give your duck back." Again, the boy agrees and another hour passes. He emerges from the house with the duck in his arms. The boy continues walking down the road when he realises that it's almost dinner time and he still hasn't sold the duck. Just as he starts panicking, a semi drives past and sucks the duck out of his arms, obliterating the poor bird. The boy starts crying and the driver slams on the brakes. He is freaking out and hops out of the truck. "I am so sorry about your duck," he says as he pulls out his wallet. "This is all I have on me. Again, I am terribly sorry." That night around the dinner table, the father asks the boys what they got for their ducks. The smart boy, ever the confident one says, "I got $17.50 for my duck." The father responds, "That's a fair price son. I'm proud of you." The dimwit son starts chuckling. "How much did you get??" The DW son replies, "Well, I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and $82.50 for a fucked up duck." Tl:dr- Boys competed for the farm by selling one duck each. The smart son got $17.50 for his. The DW got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, an $82.50 for a fucked up duck.

They leave and go to another bar and ask the bartender for a beer and his reply is the same, "We don't serve rope". On their trip to the third bar, one of the ropes goes into the bathroom and ties one of his ends together and shreds the end. He walks back out to his friends and they ask for a beer. The bartender replies "We don't serve rope". The rope replies, "I'm a frayed knot".
Two guys are walking through a field in Montana when they stumble across a well. The men look down the well and notice it is so deep, they can't see the bottom. One guys says to the other, "throw a stick into it, see how deep the well is." So the man finds a stick, tosses it in the well, the men wait for the splash...nothing. No sound. Curious to know how deep the well is, the guys start looking for something heavier to throw. The first guy remembers seeing an antelope carcass, so they drag it to the well and push it in. Woosh, the carcass drops, they wait...nothing. Suddenly a donkey comes running full speed in their direction. The donkey then dives straight into the well. Confused but still curious, the men lean in, watch and listen as the donkey falls. But still, no sound at the bottom. Eventually a farmer comes running up to them. The farmer asks "Have you guys seen my donkey." The one man responds, "Yeah it was crazy, he came out of nowhere and dove right into this well." Confused the farmer responds, "That's impossible, we was tied to an antelope carcass."
A Horse and a Chicken The horse falls into a mud hole and is sinking. He calls to the chicken to go and get the farmer to help pull him out to safety. The chicken runs to the farm but the farmer can't be found. So he drives the farmer's Mercedes back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the bumper. He then throws the other end of the rope to his friend, the horse, and drives the car forward saving him from sinking..! A few days later, the chicken and horse were playing in the meadow again and the chicken fell into the mud hole. The chicken yelled to the horse to go and get some help from the farmer. The horse said, "I think I can stand over the hole..!" So he stretched over the width of the hole and said, "Grab for my 'thingy' and pull yourself up." And the chicken did and pulled himself to safety. The moral of the story - If you are hung like a horse, you don't need a Mercedes to pick up chicks.
An Italian Girl A woman has to go to Italy for a conference, so her husband drives her to the airport. "Thank you, honey", she says. "What would you like me to bring back for you?" He laughs and says, "An Italian girl!" When the conference is over, he meets her at the airport and asks: "So, honey, how was the trip?" "Very good," she replies. "And what happened to my present?" "Which present?" she asks. "The one I asked for - an Italian girl!" "Oh, that," she says. "Well, I did what I could. Now we have to wait nine months to see if it's a girl."

"If you win the lottery, the first thing I want you to get me is a face lift and a boob job," said my 49 year old girlfriend as I was checking my ticket. "Well, actually, the first thing I would buy is a reconditioned engine and a respray for my Mondeo," I replied. "Why would you waste your money tarting that old thing up, you might as well get yourself a new one," she said. "My point exactly."
Was talking to a friend about taking many baths a day. "There's no harm in taking baths repeatedly unless you are soap."
It was a small load... A young couple got married. On their honeymoon, they were very anxious about having sex because they were both virgins. Because of their sexual inexperience, they were a bit uncomfortable discussing the subject so they came up with the term "doing the laundry" to use in place of "having sex." This made them both more comfortable with the whole concept. Well, the first night of their honeymoon was wonderful. They "did the laundry" 5 times that first night. In the middle of the night the new husband woke up, and he was ready to do the laundry again. He gently shook his new wife and asked her, "Can we do the laundry again?" but she was very tired. She told him that she just couldn't do it again just yet. Maybe in the morning. A few hours later the new wife awoke feeling very guilty. What he had asked for wasn't unreasonable, and she decided she should go ahead and "do the laundry" with him again. She gently shook him and said, "Honey, I'm sorry I denied you... We can do the laundry again if you want," He replied, "That's ok... It was a small load... I did it by hand."
Datsun cogs There was a farmer, who owned a Datsun Ute. He used this Datsun for all his farm work, feeding the horses.. Throwing bails of hay out the back of it.. Carrying firewood and what not. When all of sudden one day, *chug chug chug* it breaks down. So he decides to go back to the shed to grab his tractor and tow it back. He pulls apart his Datsun Ute and does all the fault finding and diagnostics you can imagine. He pulls apart the gearbox and finds a broken cog. So he calls up the Datsun dealership and explains to him how his Datsun Ute broke down, and he needs a new cog for it. He asks if he could help him out. The dealership tells him "Yeh mate, I can get one in for ya but it's going to take about 6-8 weeks." The farmer says, "why so long? I really need the Datsun cog for my Datsun Ute." The man replies, "Yeh sorry mate, the parts coming from Japan, nothing I can do." The farmer says "fair enough" and hangs up the phone. He comes up with the idea to just fly over there himself and pick it up, as it's costing him money not having his Datsun ute running. He buys a plane ticket to Japan expecting he's just going to get there and buy a Datsun cog and return home. He finally lands and makes his way to the Datsun factory. Out comes one of the workers and the farmer says to him, "Mate, I'm after a Datsun cog for my Datsun ute." The factory worker says "Yeh no worries, but we're a factory, you can't just buy one Datsun cog. You have to buy a 1000 Datsun cogs minimum." The farmer agrees and he takes a pallet of a 1000 Datsun cogs back onto the plane making his way home. As the planes descending the planes to heavy for the landing gear and the flight attendants announce their going to throw out anything they deem as excessive. The flight crew are staring at a pallet of a 1000 Datsun cogs, thinking who would want a 1000, it's a Datsun. So they decide to push it off the back of the plane. When at that moment the farmer comes racing in saying "stop, stop!". He reaches into the pile and grabs a Datsun cog out. And he's happy, as he got what he came for. So they push out the remainder, like 999 Datsun cogs, but let's just say a 1000, who's counting. So you can imagine, a 1000 Datsun cogs are falling from the sky from a plane, what a sight that would be. 2 other farmers, Billy and Joel, sitting out on their sun deck see exactly that. Billy yells out, "Joel! Wake up! It's raining Datsun cogs!"

He told the other two that he would build a shelter, and told the French guy to gather food and the Korean guy to get supplies. The next day, the British guy had an impressive shelter built and the French guy showed up with berries and nuts, but there was no sign of the Korean guy. Days passed, and they began to get worried, so they set off in search of him. They walked through the jungle for three days without any sign of the Korean guy. Then on the fourth day, as they were about to give up hope, the Korean guy suddenly popped out from behind a rock and yelled "supplies!"

My job is so fucking unbelievable. I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with: First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on make-up. She is extremely self-centred and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe. The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her "womanly" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store she moans like a cat in heat. But the jewel in the crown has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober any time in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonald's and Burger King, every single fucking day. Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.
Three sons were getting birthday presents for their dad, who was getting up there in years. After they had all chosen said presents they met to discuss what they had gotten him.

The second one, Jim said "I got dad a set of golf clubs because his old ones were getting worn." The final son, Tyler said "I got dad a specially trained parrot to read for him because his eyes are weak. It was more expensive then I could have imagined but it was worth every penny". Two weeks later they got the thank you notes back from their father. Michaels said "dear Michael, it was a nice thought but I have given up hunting because it is cruel and I am getting old." The second one was Jim's and it said this "dear Jim, nice try but I have given up golfing because my bones are frail and the people who play are jerks." Finally Tyler's said this."ahh Tyler you always were my favorite son and I really appreciated the gift. Who knew such a talkative bird could be so delicious?"

Cannibals these days.. Three guys got shipwrecked on an island. The native cannibals immediately snatched them up and told them they will soon be killed and eaten. However, these cannibals loved sport so they challenged each man to venture out into the jungle and bring back ten of a certain type of fruit. The winner may have his life spared. The first guy came back to the group of cannibals with ten apples. The cannibals then said, "If you can shove all ten of those fruits into your ass without making a face or a sound then your life will be spared." So the first guy began shoving away. He got through the first and second apple with no problem. While shoving the third in there, he made a tiny squeal and was killed. The second guy came back with ten grapes. The cannibals make him go through the same process. Now this guy has it set and is going through this challenge with no problem. Then on the ninth grape he starts laughing hysterically out loud. The cannibals then kill him. Now up in heaven the first guy asks, "What happened, you were about to be set free?" The second guy says, "Well it was going perfectly fine, but when I got to that ninth grape I saw the third guy come back. He came back with ten watermelons."

A rabbit and a bear dig up an old lamp A rabbit and a bear are digging for some tasty roots when they come across an old lamp. The bear immediately claims it and yanks it out of the rabbits grasp. Wiping off the dirt from the lamp with them in the process. Immediately a genie bursts from the lamp shouting: *"Thank you for freeing me from that prison! I'll grant you 3 wishes each!"* The bear quickly says: *"I wish that all female bears are willing to mate with me whenever I want!"* *"Done!"* says the genie. The rabbits thinks for a while and says: *"Well, I wish for a nice bright red helmet!"* *"As you wish!"* says the genie and he hands him a beautiful red helmet. The bear smirks at the rabbits wish and says: *"What a ridiculous wish. Why would you want that?"* Without awaiting the rabbits answer he turns to the genie and states: *"My second wish is that my libido and sexual stamina are increased a thousandfold!"* *"Done!"* says the genie. *"For my second wish"*, says the rabbit, *"I'd like a bright red ultrafast motorcycle which I can drive easily."* *"As you wish!"* says the genie and he hands him a perfectly sized bright red ultrafast motorcycle. Once again the bear laughs at the rabbits' wish. *"Foolish rabbit! You can have anything you ever dreamed of and you wish for THAT??!"* Once again the bear turns to the genie. *"Genie!"*, he shouts, *"For my final wish I'd like that all the other bears in the world will become female!"* Once again the genie says: *"Done"*. *"OK then"*, says the rabbit as he gets onto his new bright red ultrafast motorcycle and starts speeding off shouting:*"for my final wish I wish that that bear turns gay!"*

Detective Interviewing for a Future Disciple Before you read: When I say "profile picture" I mean a picture of someone facing the left or the right rather than directly at the camera. A Detective needs someone to work under him, so he decided to do tryouts and it came down to 3 people. The Detective interviewed each of the future disciples one by one in his office. The first person comes in and the Detective gets right to the point: Detective:*points finger at a profile picture of an escaped criminal* "Alright son, name me the identifying features of this criminal right here." Person 1: "Well this man would be easy to find, considering he is walking around with only one eye." Detective: "... You are dumb, leave now and tell one of the other two guys outside to come in." *Person 1 leaves and Person 2 enters* Detective:*points finger at a profile picture of an escaped criminal* "Alright son, name me the identifying features of this criminal right here." Person 2: "From what I can see, this man would be pretty easy to find considering the fact that he is walking around town with only one ear." Detective: "... What is wrong with today's youth.. leave and tell the last guy that he may come in for his interview" *Person 2 leaves an Person 3 enters* Detective: "Well you are the last guy and hopefully you are a bit smarter than the last two guys, those two... I don't even know.. *points finger at the profile picture of an escaped criminal* please name me the identifying features of this criminal right here." Person 3: "This man wears contacts." Detective:*looks through the criminal's files to see that the criminal does in fact wear contact lenses* "Wow son, even though that isn't really an identifying feature, how did you know that?!"

Bag limit. A guy was on his boat fishing in a pond and caught way over the bag limit. He was heading back to the dock when the game warden stopped him and asked to check what he caught. The warden opens the fishermen's cooler and sees that the guy has surpassed his limit by about 20 fish. The warden tells the man he has too many fish and he is going to cite the fishermen. The fishermen says "No, you see these are my pet fish. I didn't catch them I called them to me". The warden doesn't believe the guy, and so the fishermen tells the warden he will show him. The guy dumps the cooler of fish in the water. The warden waits a minute and says to the guy "ok now call the fish back". ... "What fish?"

A short minute later, a waitress comes over and asks "Have you decided on what you'd like?" The man replies with "Yes, I'd love a plate of your Eggs Benedict." "Excellent choice," she says, "and would like hollandaise sauce to go with that? It's delicious." The man thinks for a second and says "Sure, sounds good." A few minutes pass. Finally, the man sees the waitress come to the table carrying a massive hubcap covered in his Eggs Benedict. The man is in shock. "What the hell is this?! I demand to speak to your chef at once!" The chef comes to the table and asks "What seems to be the problem sir?" "What do you think my problem is?! Explain this massive hubcap on my table!" The chef looks at the hubcap, and then back at the man with a confused look on his face. "But sir, you ordered the Eggs Benedict with hollandaise, and as I'm sure you're aware, there's no plate like chrome for the hollandaise!"

" Doc says, "Well, OK, I guess I could make this one exception. I don't understand it, but OK. " He puts Fred to sleep, does the trick, and is waiting at the bedside when Fred wakes up. "Well, Doc, how'd it go? " Fred asks. "It went fine, just fine. It's really not too difficult of an operation. As a matter of fact, $5,000 is a lot to pay for such a simple task, and I felt a little guilty about taking that much. So, while I was operating, I also noticed that you had never been circumcised, so I went ahead and did that, too. I think, it's really better for a man to be circumcised, and I hope you don't mind my... " "CIRCUMCISED! " yells Fred. "THAT'S the word!!! "

An Irish priest was transferred to Texas. Father O'Malley rose from his bed one morning. It was a fine spring day in his new west Texas mission parish. He walked to the window of his bedroom to get a deep breath of the beautiful day outside. He then noticed there was a jackass lying dead in the middle of his front lawn. He promptly called the local police station. The conversation went like this: "Good morning. This is Sergeant Jones. How might I help you?" "And the best of the day te yerself. This is Father O'Malley at St. Ann 's Catholic Church. There's a jackass lying dead in me front lawn and would ye be so kind as to send a couple o'yer lads to take care of the matter?" Sergeant Jones, considering himself to be quite a wit and recognizing the foreign accent, thought he would have a little fun with the good father, replied, "Well now Father, it was always my impression that you people took care of the last rites!" There was dead silence on the line for a long moment....... Father O'Malley then replied: "Aye,'tis certainly true; but we are also obliged to notify the next of kin first, which is the reason for me call.
The art of hunting elephants (By profession) Hunting Elephants MATHEMATICIANS hunt elephants by going to Africa, throwing out everything that is not an elephant, and catching one of whatever is left. EXPERIENCED MATHEMATICIANS will attempt to prove the existence of at least one unique elephant before proceeding to step 1 as a subordinate exercise. PROFESSORS OF MATHEMATICS will prove the existence of at least one unique elephant and then leave the detection and capture of an actual elephant as an exercise for their graduate students. COMPUTER SCIENTISTS hunt elephants by exercising Algorithm A A: 1. Go to Africa. 2. Start at the Cape of Good Hope. 3. Work northward in an orderly manner, traversing the continent alternately east and west. 4. During each traverse pass, a. Catch each animal seen. b. Compare each animal caught to a known elephant. c. Stop when a match is detected. EXPERIENCED COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS modify Algorithm A by placing a known elephant in Cairo to ensure that the algorithm will terminate. ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAMMERS prefer to execute Algorithm A on their hands and knees. ENGINEERS hunt elephants by going to Africa, catching gray animals at random, and stopping when any one of them weighs within plus or minus 15 percent of any previously observed elephant. ECONOMISTS don't hunt elephants, but they believe that if elephants are paid enough, they will hunt themselves. STATISTICIANS hunt the first animal they see N times and call it an elephant. CONSULTANTS don't hunt elephants, and many have never hunted anything at all, but they can be hired by the hour to advise those people who do. OPERATIONS RESEARCH CONSULTANTS can also measure the correlation of hat size and bullet color to the efficiency of elephant-hunting strategies, if someone else will only identify the elephants. POLITICIANS don't hunt elephants, but they will share the elephants you catch with the people who voted for them. LAWYERS don't hunt elephants, but they do follow the herds around arguing about who owns the droppings. SOFTWARE LAWYERS will claim that they own an entire herd based on the look and feel of one dropping. VICE PRESIDENTS OF ENGINEERING, RESEARCH, AND DEVELOPMENT try hard to hunt elephants, but their staffs are designed to prevent it. When the vice president does get to hunt elephants, the staff will try to ensure that all possible elephants are completely prehunted before the vice president sees them. If the vice president does see a nonprehunted elephant, the staff will (1) compliment the vice president's keen eyesight and (2) enlarge itself to prevent any recurrence. SENIOR MANAGERS set broad elephant-hunting policy based on the assumption that elephants are just like field mice, but with deeper voices. QUALITY ASSURANCE INSPECTORS ignore the elephants and look for mistakes the other hunters made when they were packing the jeep. SALES PEOPLE don't hunt elephants but spend their time selling elephants they haven't caught, for delivery two days before the season opens. SOFTWARE SALES PEOPLE ship the first thing they catch and write up an invoice for an elephant. HARDWARE SALES PEOPLE catch rabbits, paint them gray, and sell them as desktop elephants.
Man sits at a bar and orders five shots... the bartender asks the guy, "What's up bud? You look rough." "Well," says the man, "I just found out my dad is gay and he's left my mom for some pool boy." "Ouch," says the bartender, "here, these are on the house today." A few days later the same guy comes in and orders another five shots. "Oh no man, what happened this time?" The bartender asks. "Just found out my brother is gay, he's left his wife for a man he met at a gay bar last week." "I'm sorry man," the bartender says, "these are on the house." Just one week later the guy comes in again and orders ten shots. The bartender asks, "Man! Doesn't anyone in your family like women?" The guy responds, "Yeah...my wife."

An Olympic swimmer... ...is on a cruise ship, when it hits a reef and sinks. Bobbing in the waves, he spies an island in the distance, makes for it, and barely gets ashore. All he finds on the isle are fruit trees, a female sheep and a big dog. The fruit trees provide sustenance, but he starts to feel lonely. The sheep has luxurious fur, beautiful eyes and long lashes that she shyly bats at him. When he approaches her, the dog viciously attacks and repels him. This goes on for months, until he can hardly bear it. One day he sees another ship sinking at sea. Swimming out, he sees a woman thrashing in the waves. He saves her as she's about to perish, and hauls her ashore. As luck would have it, she's absolutely gorgeous. "I'm so grateful to you for saving my life...I'll do anything you ask, as a way to repay you." The swimmer can't believe his luck. "Anything?" The young woman smiles coyly. "Anything your heart desires." "Can you take that big dog over there for a walk?"

A priest and a nun ... ... are on a pilgrimage when they get caught in a blizzard. They make their way to a small abandoned cabin with a bed, a stack of blankets, and a sleeping bag. Now the priest, being a gentleman, offers the nun the bed and takes the sleeping bag for himself. They say their nightly prayers and tuck in for the night. The priest is nearly asleep when he is awoken by the nun, "Father, I'm cold!" The priest gets up, puts a blanket on her, checks that she's OK, and goes back to his sleeping bag. This time he's starting to nod off when he's again awoken by the nun, "Father, I'm still cold!" So once again the priest gets up, places another blanket on the nun, and heads back to his sleeping bag. But when he's almost asleep this time she calls again, "Father, Father, I'm sooo cold!" The priest thinks on this situation and after a moment he responds. "Sister, we are in the middle of nowhere in a storm. No one but ourselves and the Lord God almighty will know what happens here this night. What would you say if, just for this night, we act as though we were married?" The nun thinks on this for a while and finally responds with an excited, "Yes Father, I'd like that!" To which the priest responds, ... ... "GET UP AND GET YOUR OWN DAMNED BLANKET YA HARPY!"

Last week, ,y girlfriend and i Last week, my girlfriend and I were getting into bed. As our passion began to heat up she said, "I don't feel like it. I just want you to hold me." I said, "WHAT?! What was that?!" She said, "You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man." She responded to my puzzled look by saying, "Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?" Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep. The next day I took off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big department store. I walked around with her as she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to go with her new clothes, so I said, "Lets get a pair for each outfit." We went on to the j3welry counter where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. She was so excited. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet. I threw her for a loop when I said, "That's fine, honey." She was nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, "I think this is all dear, let's go to the cashier." I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, "No baby, I don't feel like it." Her face went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, "WHAT?" I said, "Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman." Just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, "Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?" Apparently I'm not having sex tonight either... but at least she knows I'm smarter than her.

Urinalysis One day, in line at the company cafeteria, Jack says to Mike behind him, "My elbow hurts like hell. I guess I better see a doctor." "Listen, you don't have to spend that kind of money," Mike replies. "There's a diagnostic computer at the drugstore at the corner. Just give it a urine sample and the computer'll tell you what's wrong and what to do about it. It takes ten seconds and costs ten dollars...a hell of a lot cheaper than a doctor." So Jack deposits a urine sample in a small jar and takes it to the drugstore. He deposits ten dollars, and the computer lights up and asks for the urine sample. He pours the sample into the slot and waits. Ten seconds later, the computer ejects a printout: You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water and avoid heavy activity. It will improve in two weeks. That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was, Jack began wondering if the computer could be fooled. He mixed some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, urine samples from his wife and daughter, and masturbated into the mixture for good measure. Jack hurries back to the drugstore, eager to check the results. He deposits ten dollars, pours in his concoction, and awaits the results. The computer prints the following: 1. Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. 2. Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo. 3. Your daughter has a cocaine habit. Get her into rehab. 4. Your wife is pregnant...twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. 5. If you don't stop playing with yourself, your elbow will never get better.
Three dogs were sitting in the waiting room at the vet's when they struck up a conversation... The Yellow Labrador turned to the Black Labrador and said, "So why are you here?" The Black Lab replied, "I'm a pisser. I piss on everything.....the sofa, the curtains, the cat, the kids. But the final straw was last night when I pissed in the middle of my owner's bed." The Yellow Lab said, "So what's the vet going to do?" "Gonna cut my nuts off " came the reply from the Black Lab. They reckon it'll calm me down." The Black Lab then turned to the Yellow Lab and asked "why are you here?" The Yellow Lab said, "I'm a digger. I dig under fences, dig up flowers and trees, I dig just for the hell of it. When I'm inside, I dig up the carpets. But I went over the line last night when I dug a great big hole in my owners' couch." "So what are they going to do to you?" the Black Lab inquired. "Looks like I'm losing my nuts too," the dejected Yellow Lab said. The Black Lab then turned to the Great Dane and asked, "Why are you here?" "I'm a humper," said the Great Dane. "I'll hump anything. I'll hump the cat, a pillow, the table, fence posts, whatever. I want to hump everything I see. Yesterday my owner had just got out of the shower and was bending down to dry her toes. I just couldn't help myself. I hopped on her back and started hammering away." The Black and the Yellow Labs exchanged a sad glance and said, " So, it's nuts off for you too, huh?" The Great Dane replied, "No, apparently I'm here to get my nails clipped."

Blonde Research Study An American research firm is tasked with conducting a study to determine if blonde women truly are less intelligent than everyone else. To do this, they host a convention for blonde women at an airport Hilton. At the orientation meeting, the chief researcher greets the crowd in a large banquet room. "Thank you all so very much for coming", the researcher remarks. "We'll have a number of seminars and activities in which you will all participate this weekend, but to get things started, I'd like to select one of you to come up on stage and answer a few math questions as a bit of an icebreaker". A voluptuous young blonde woman is selected to come on stage, and so begins the researcher's questions. "What is 30 + 40?", asks the researcher. "Ummmmm....80?", responds the blonde. Upon hearing the answer, the crowd shouts "GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE". The researcher, playing along, replies "Alright alright. What is 15 + 15?". The blonde, a bit hesitant now to embarrass herself again, replies, albeit a bit apprehensively "Uhhhhhh...40??". The crowd, eager to support this poor woman, shouts once again "GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE". The researcher, now chuckling at the apparent ineptitude of the woman onstage with him, replies "Ok ok ok one last shot. What is 2 + 2?". The woman's demeanor immediately picks up, as she's certain she knows the answer this time. Confidently, she responds "Four!". Immediately, the crowd again shouts "GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE".

So a Jewish family has a baby! It's a beautiful baby boy, and they love him very much. The dad wants to know, however, what the little boy will grow up to be like. So he takes the baby to the Rabbi, who says that there's a simple test. On a long table, the Rabbi places a stack of money, a bottle of whiskey, and a Torah. "If your son crawls to the money, he'll have a good job as a banker, and take care of you and your wife until you're dead and gone. If he goes for the whiskey, he's no good, a drunk, might as well drop him at the orphanage on the way home for all the good he'll do you. Finally, if he picks up the Torah, he'll be a Rabbi like me. A good, honest, man of God." So the father puts the baby on the table, and the baby picks up the money. "YAY!" they cheer, as the baby starts crawling again. Now, the Rabbi looks worried. The baby now picks up the bottle of whiskey with its other hand. "Oh no" says the Rabbi. They then watch as the baby crawls again, and also picks up the Torah. "NO NO NO NO!!!!!!!!!" the Rabbi cries. "WHAT IS IT??? What's wrong with my son?!?!" the father panicks. "I'm so so sorry, but your son is going to be the worst thing of all!" says the Rabbi. "Your son is going to be a Catholic!" [EDIT: Homonyms suck. You're/your. Could be worse, I could've said "yore" ]

2 Indians and a Polack were walking around the woods... When one of the Indians bolts up a hill, stands in front of a cave and yells "Whoo Whoo!" A faint "Whoo Whoo" was heard, and the Indian tears his clothes off, and runs into the cave and doesn't come back out. The Polack asks the Indian "What the hell was that all about?" "Well, this time of year is Iroquois mating season. In every cave on top of a hill, an Iroquois woman is waiting for any man to come to them, and have sex with them for days on end. However, you must yell Whoo Whoo, and if you get one back, you go in." The Polack thought this was the greatest thing, and they both were walking along looking for a cave on a hill. The Indian spots one first, runs up, yells "Whoo Whoo", tears off his clothes and runs in the cave. After hours of walking by himself, the Polack eventually finds a huge hill! He gets excited, runs up to see an even bigger cave! The Polack thinks to himself "Gee, this is a pretty big hill... And this cave is just something else... I think I'll have to make whoever is in there think I'm some huge tough warrior!" The Pollack lets out his biggest "**WHOOOOOOOOOO WHOOOOOOOOOO**" He waits, and hears "**WHOOOOOOOOOOOO WHOOOOOOOOOOOO**" Without hesitation, the Polack strips down, and runs into the cave. In the newspaper the next day, the headline read "Naked Polack struck by train in tunnel"

There is this Jewish boy who was born into a nice family... There is this Jewish boy who was born into a nice family. He was a very smart boy, but he never did well in school because he lacked motivation. His parents tried everything: meeting with his teachers, one on one tutoring, etc.; however, nothing seemed to help. Eventually, they decided to send him to a private school, thinking a different environment would him good. Unfortunately, there are not many Jewish private schools, so they had to settle on sending him to a Catholic school. Surprisingly, this worked. The parents got his first report card and were astounded: all A's. The parents wondered what brought about the change. They said to their son "You made all A's! Even in math! (previously his worst subject) what changed?" The son replied "When I walked in on the first day and saw the Jewish guy nailed to the plus sign, I knew they were serious."

The cowboy answered, "You've left your Injun runnin'."

The Ostrich A man walks into a restaurant with a full-grown ostrich behind him. The waitress asks them for their orders. The man says, "A hamburger, fries and a coke," and turns to the ostrich, "What's yours?" "I'll have the same," says the ostrich. A short time later the waitress returns with the order. "That will be $9.40 please." The man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment. The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, "A hamburger, fries and a coke." The ostrich says, "I'll have the same." Again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. This becomes routine until the two enter again. "The usual?" asks the waitress. "No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato and a salad," says the man. "Same," says the ostrich. Shortly the waitress brings the order and says, "That will be $32.62." Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. The waitress cannot hold back her curiosity any longer. "Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change in your pocket every time?" "Well," says the man, "several years ago I was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it, a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there." "That's brilliant!" says the waitress. "Most people would ask for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!" "That's right. Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there," says the man. The waitress asks, "What's with the ostrich?" The man sighs, pauses and answers, "My second wish was for a tall chick with a big ass and long legs who agrees with everything I say.."
Why shouldn't you argue with a 90 degree angle? It's always right.

Norma Findlay A sweet old lady telephoned St. Joseph 's Hospital. She timidly asked, "Is it possible to speak to someone who can tell me how a patient is doing?" The operator said, "I'll be glad to help, dear. What's the name and room number of the patient?" The old lady in her weak, tremulous voice said, "Norma Findlay, Room 302." The operator replied, "Let me put you on hold while I check with the nurse's station for that room." After a few minutes, the operator returned to the phone and said, "I have good news. Her nurse just told me that Norma is doing well. Her blood pressure is fine; her blood work just came back normal, and her physician, Dr. Cohen, has scheduled her to be discharged tomorrow." The old lady said, "Thank you. That's wonderful. I was so worried. God bless you for the good news." The operator replied, "You're more than welcome. Is Norma your daughter?" The old lady said, "No, I'm Norma Findlay in Room 302. No one tells me shit."

A young guy from North Dakota moves to Florida and goes to a big "everything under one roof" department store looking for a job... A young guy from North Dakota moves to Florida and goes to a big "everything under one roof" department store looking for a job. The Manager says, "Do you have any sales experience?" The kid says "Yeah. I was a vacuum salesman back in North Dakota." Well, the boss was unsure, but he liked the kid and figured he'd give him a shot, so he gave him the job.  "You start tomorrow. I'll come down after we close and see how you did." His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the boss came down to the sales floor. "How many customers bought something from you today?" The kid frowns and looks at the floor and mutters, "One". The boss says "Just one?!!? Our sales people average sales to 20 to 30 customers a day.  That will have to change, and soon, if you'd like to continue your employment here. We have very strict standards for our sales force here in Florida. One sale a day might have been acceptable in North Dakota, but you're not on the farm anymore, son."  The kid took his beating, but continued to look at his shoes, so the boss felt kinda bad for chewing him out on his first day. He asked (semi-sarcastically), "So, how much was your one sale for?"  The kid looks up at his boss and says "$101,237.65".  The boss, astonished, says $101,237.65?!? What the heck did you sell?"  The kid says, "Well, first, I sold him some new fish hooks. Then I sold him a new fishing rod to go with his new hooks. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin engine Chris Craft. Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4x4 Expedition."  The boss said "A guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat and a TRUCK!?" The kid said "No, the guy came in here to buy tampons for his wife, and I said, 'Dude, your weekend's shot, you should go fishing.........'"

Cowboy Singer There was this country singing cowboy in a dark saloon one night. He got up to play and announced his first song, "I wrote this one a long time ago, its called 'Ol' Boil on My Foot is Burnin'" The audience had a general look of confusion but the cowboy went on to play most beautiful, sad country song many had ever heard. He quickly moved on to the next tune, "This ballad is about the night my ex left me, its called 'She Can't Handle the Bumps on My Pecker" Again, the audience gasped but quickly retracted as an amazing piece of musical genius was displayed before them. The cowboy continued to play many songs with egregious titles that were just beautiful. As setbreak ended the cowboy emerged from the bathroom and took the stage. Little to his knowing he didn't zip up and his johnson was dangling out of his pants. A man in the audience quickly yelled, "Your Tallywacker's hanging out flapping in the wind!" The cowboy responded "Sure, buddy, I'll play that one next."

The World's Funniest Joke. So this guy names Richard Wiseman did some research in 2002 at the University of Hertfordshire, and he concluded that this was the world's funniest joke.

There is a silence, then a gun shot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says "OK, now what?"

A bird in hand..... So there was this farmer, his son, and the only animal on their farm that survived the winter: a duck. One day, a farmer is sits down to pay some bills, when he realizes he's falling short of some money. Racking his brain for a bit, he finally decides to sell of the family's last duck, in exchange for a little money. With a heavy sigh, he calls his teenage son and tells him to go to the nearby town and sell the duck for as much money as he can. Without further ado, the boy starts off to town, duck tucked in arm. However, before he's travelled too far, he chances upon a beautiful hooker, who he just can't keep his eyes off. The hooker looked straight at the boy and said, "The fucking begins at $10, you got $10?" The boy has no money, obviously, so he starts to walk away, but the hooker stops him and says she'dd accept the duck as payment. Throwing caution to the wind, and immediately forgetting about his poor ass father, he gleefully accepts her offer. An hour later, just as the boy gets ready to leave, the hooker grabs him and begs to be fucked again--it was, without a doubt, the single best fuck of her life. Somewhat surprised, the boy accepts when she offers the duck back to him; this is just too good to be true, he thinks. Another hour passes, and the boy heads to town again, doubly satisfied and, to top it all, with his duck in his hand. On the way, while crossing a sharp bend in the road, the duck gets spooked and flies from the boy's hands, heading directly on to an oncoming car, kamikaze'ing the Hell out of itself. The man driving gets out and appologizes, fearing he's just killed the boy's only source of food or income. Ridden with guilt, he hands the boy 25 dollars for his trouble and goes on his way, purged of his sin. The boy, now duckless and relatively rich, goes home and hands his father the money. The father, livid at the menial amount, flies off the handle and asks what happened. Looking his father dead in the eyes, he says: "Well, I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and 25 bucks for a fucked up duck."

Invitation to a Scientists' ball Some of the replies from the scientists invited: Pierre and Marie Curie were radiating enthusiasm. Einstein thought it would be relatively easy to attend. Volta was electrified and Archimedes, buoyant at the thought. Ampere was worried he wasn't up to current research. Ohm resisted the idea at first. Boyle said he was under too much pressure. Edison thought it would be an illuminating experience. Watt reckoned it would be a good way to let off steam. Stephenson thought the whole idea was loco. Wilbur Wright accepted, provided he and Orville could get a flight. Dr Jekyll declined -- he hadn't been feeling himself lately. Morse's reply: "I'll be there on the dot. Can't stop now must dash." Heisenberg was uncertain if he could make it. Hertz said in the future he planned to attend with greater frequency. Henry begged off due to a low capacity for alcohol. Audobon said he'd have to wing it. Hawking said he'd try to string enough time together to make a space in his schedule. Darwin said he'd have to see what evolved. Schrodinger had to take his cat to the vet, or did he? Mendel said he'd put some things together and see what came out. Descartes said he'd think about it. Newton was moved to attend. Pavlov was drooling at the thought. Gauss was asked to attend because of his magnetic personality. JP Clark &amp; Siegfried the Deerslayer Wanna-Be

A bit dated, but it gave me a chuckle nonetheless. (Blatantly stolen from a grandma email.) A cowboy named Bud was overseeing his herd in a remote mountainous pasture in Montana when suddenly a brand-new BMW advanced toward him out of a cloud of dust. The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, RayBan sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, "If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?" Bud looks at the man, who obviously is a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, "Sure, why not?" The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3 cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo. The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany ... Within seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, receives a response. Finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet printer, turns to the cowboy and says, "You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves." "That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves," says Bud. He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car. Then Bud says to the young man, "Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?" The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, "Okay, why not?" "You're a Congressman for the U.S. Government", says Bud. "Wow! That's correct," says the yuppie, "but how did you guess that?" "No guessing required." answered the cowboy. "You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked. You used millions of dollars worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know a thing about how working people make a living - or about cows, for that matter. This is a herd of sheep." "Now give me back my dog."
Barrack Obama, Vladimir Putin and Angela Merkel are having a meeting... ...and at one point they start bragging about their submarine fleets. Obama goes: "We have a submarine that can stay submerged for 4 months straight", to wich Putin replies: "Phwahaha, thats nothing! We have a submarine that can stay submerged for 8 months!" After that, they look at Angela, wondering what she has to say. And with a lot of embarassement and insecurity in her voice she says: "i don't really know a thing about our fleet...so i cant tell" And just at that moment a submarine emerges at the naval base in Kiel, a sailor steps out and yells: "Heil Hitler! We need diesel!"

Karl Marx passed away and went to hell... After some days, Lucifer, caretaker of the hell met with Angel, who take care of Heaven. Yes, they meet sometimes in the corridors of heavenly worlds! Today Lucifer was gloomy. When Angel asked about his sadness, Lucifer replied. "There is a new guy in hell named Karl Marx. He created all kinds of trouble in Hell. Now employee demons are striking and day-to-day work is not functioning in hell. Now there is a union for demons!" To this angel replied "Why don't you consider sending him to Heaven for sometime? May be I can make him change his ways." Lucifer agreed to this but warned Angel that Marx is a difficult guy to convince. Max went to the heaven. After some days Lucifer met Angel in the corridor. Lucifer: "How is it with Karl Marx? Is there any trouble in Heaven?" Angel: "Trouble? There is no trouble! He is absolutely fine in Heaven! Keep him there itself" Replied Angel with a cheerful face. Lucifer got worried. He can't keep Marx for long in the Heaven because God desn't know about this transfer. Lucifer: "But..we can't keep him there. What will god say if he comes to know about this!" Angel: "God? Isn't that a bourgeoisie concept, Comrade?!"

Man takes the gallon tequila challenge. A man after work stops by a pub for a drink. After sitting down he notices a sign saying "Finish the gallon tequila challenge and win free drinks for life." When the bartender approached, the man inquired and the bar tender explained, "nobody has ever finished it as of yet. First you must finish a gallon of tequila. After completing that you must pull a broken tooth from our Rotwieler in the back. If you complete that, the last challenge is to bring to orgasm the 90 year old original owner of the bar who still lives upstairs. Do all that and you get free drinks from here for life." The man was shocked and said it was a ridiculous challenge. However, after a couple of pints and encouragement from fellow patrons he signed the liability waiver and finished the gallon of tequila. The bartender led the man out back where the dog was kept. Over 5 minutes had passed and the dog could be heard yelping, growling and finally quiet. The man re-entered the bar covered in cuts, bruises and breathing heavily. He looked at the bartender and said triumphantly, "ok, so where is that old lady with the broken tooth?!"

My cousin Fred wears lace underpants My cousin Fred, who I had not seen for years, visited us during the holidays. After a good game of racquetball, I noticed in the shower that he was wearing frilly lace underwear. It was kind of awkward, but on the drive home, curiosity got the better of me and I had to ask him: "Say Fred, I noticed you were wearing some lace underpants." "Yeah, they are women's underpants." "Oh - okay. I didn't know you were... er... since when did you start wearing that?" "Well, ever since my wife found them in my glove compartment."
2 hearses. One fall day Dave was out raking leaves when he noticed a hearse slowly drive by. Following the first hearse was a second hearse, which was followed by a man walking solemnly along, followed by a dog, and then about 200 men walking in single file. Intrigued, Dave went up to the man following the second hearse and asked him who was in the first hearse. "My wife," the man replied. "I'm sorry," said Dave. "What happened to her?" "My dog bit her and she died." Dave then asked who was in the second hearse. The man replied, "My mother-in-law. My dog bit her and she died as well." "Can I borrow your dog?" "Get in line." replied the man.
A man sits at the bar drinking and looking upset. The bartender asks him what's wrong. The man looks up and says "I lost it all playing the ponies. A million dollars. I had it and I lost it all." The bartender is taken aback. "If you don't mind me prying, a million dollars is a lot of money. How'd you end up losing it?" The man downs his drink. "Pour me another and I'll tell you. I went to the track with five dollars. That's it. I was only gonna spend five and go home. So I gets a good feeling about this horse named Fedora. He had incredible odds so I went for it. Turns out he won. So I makes a five into a hundred. I'm on a roll now, so in the next race I bets on a horse named Top Hat. Again, the odds are in my favour. He wins, and I turns a hundred into six thousand. It continues all day, every race. Beret made 6000 into 120,000. And Trilby makes 120,000 into 1,200,000. That's no small potatoes. I shoulda known hat names wouldn't work forever, but I thought I had a winner with Cowboy. He lost. I lost." The bartender is invested in the story by this point. He waits with bated breath. "So who won?" "Some dumbass horse named Yarmulke."

A Horse And A Chicken... ...Were playing in a meadow. The horse fell into a mud hole and is started to sink. The horse instructed the chicken to get the farmer so that he could be pulled to safety. The chicken ran to the farm but the farmer was nowhere to be found.... Without a moment to spare,the chicken got into the farmer's BMW and drove back to the mud hole. Then, the chicken tied some rope around the bumper, threw the other end of the rope to her friend, the horse, and proceeded to pull the horse to safety. A few days later, the chicken and the horse were playing in the meadow again. This time around, the chicken fell into the mud hole. The chicken instructed the horse to get the farmer so that she could be pulled to safety. Replied the horse, "Here's the plan... I'll stand over the hole..." The horse stretched over the length of the hole and continued, "Now, just grab for my penis and pull yourself to safety." The chicken obliged reluctantly and pulled herself to safety. The moral of the story: If you're hung like a horse, you don't need a BMW to pick up chicks.
A frog goes into a bank and approaches the teller... He can see from her nameplate that her name is Patricia Whack. 'Miss Whack, I'd like to get a $30,000 loan to take a holiday.' Patty looks at the frog in disbelief and asks his name. The frog says his name is Kermit Jagger, his dad is Mick Jagger, and that it's okay, he knows the bank manager. Patty explains that he will need to secure the loan with some collateral. The frog says, 'Sure. I have this,' and produces a tiny porcelain elephant, about an inch tall, bright pink and perfectly formed. Very confused, Patty explains that she'll have to consult with the bank manager and disappears into a back office. She finds the manager and says, 'There's a frog called Kermit Jagger out there who claims to know you and wants to borrow $30,000, and he wants to use this as collateral.' She holds up the tiny pink elephant. 'I mean, what in the world is this?' The bank manager looks back at her and says... 'It's a knickknack, Patty Whack. Give the frog a loan, His old man's a Rolling Stone.'

Little Johnny One day at the end of class, little Johnny's teacher asked the class to go home and think of a story and then conclude with the moral of that story. The following day the teacher asks for the first volunteer to tell their story. Little Suzy raises her hand. "My dad owns a farm and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell them at the market. Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road." The teacher asks for the moral of the story. Suzy replies, "Don't keep all your eggs in one basket." Next is little Bobby. "Well, my dad owns a farm too and every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only 8 of the 12 eggs hatched." Teacher asks for the moral of the story. Bobby replies, "Don't count your eggs before they're hatched." Last is little Johnny. "My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war. His plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed with only a case of beer, a machine gun, and a machete. On the way down he drank the case of beer. Unfortunately, he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then ran out of bullets, so he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. The blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands." Teacher looks in shock at Johnny and asks if there is possibly any moral to his story. Johnny replies, "Don't fuck with uncle Ted when he's been drinking."

Woman: Betcha the lying bastard told you I was speeding too

"Could the condoms be red in color and at least 10" long and 4" in diameter?" said Yeltsin. "No problem," replied the President and, with that, Clinton hung up and called the President of Trojan. "I need a favor....you've got to make 1,000,000 condoms right away and send them to Russia." "Consider it done," said the President of Trojan. "Great!

The dad replies, "Easy. Go ask Mom if she'd sleep with the neighbor for a million dollars." The kid runs off, and then returns. "She said yes." "Now go ask your sister the same question." The kid does as he's asked. "She also said yes." The dad answers, "So, potentially, we're sitting on 2 million dollars. But realistically, we're living with a pair of whores."

It's going to bite one of my customers and I'm going to get sued." The guy says, "No no no, it's a tame alligator. I'll prove it to you." He picks up the alligator and puts it on the bar. Then he unzips his pants, pulls out his package and sticks it in the alligator's mouth. The alligator just keeps his mouth open. After about 5 minutes, he pulls it out of the alligator's mouth and zips up his pants and says, "See, I told you it was a tame alligator. Anybody else want to try it?" The drunk down at the end of the bar says, "Yah, I'd like to try it but I don't think I can hold my mouth open that long!"

"I've got an 30 year old bride who's pregnant and having my child! What do you think about that?" The doctor considered this for a moment, then said, "Let me tell you a story. I knew a guy who was an avid hunter. He never missed a season. But one day he went out in a bit of a hurry and he accidentally grabbed his umbrella instead of his gun." The doctor continued, "So he was in the woods and suddenly a grizzly bear appeared in front of him! He raised up his umbrella, pointed it at the bear and squeezed the handle." "And do you know what happened?" the doctor queried. Dumbfounded, the old man replied "No". The doctor continued, "The bear dropped dead in front of him!" "That's impossible!" exclaimed the old man. "Someone else must have shot that bear." "That's kind of what I'm getting at..." replied the doctor.

Dog for sale A guy sees a sign in front of a house: "Talking Dog for Sale." He rings the bell and the owner tells him the dog is in the backyard. The guy goes into the backyard and sees a black mutt just sitting there. "You talk?" he asks. "Sure do." the dog replies. "So, what's your story?" The dog looks up and says, "Well, I discovered my gift of talking pretty young and I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA about my gift, and in no time they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping. I was one of their most valuable spies eight years running." "The jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger and I wanted to settle down. So I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security work, mostly wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings there and was awarded a batch of medals." "Had a wife, a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired." The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog. The owner says, "Ten dollars." The guy says, "This dog is amazing. Why on earth are you selling him so cheap?" "Cause he's a liar. He didn't do any of that shit!"
Halloween at a Hospital. An extremely modest man was in the hospital for a series of tests, the last of which had left his bodily systems extremely upset. Upon making several false alarm trips to the bathroom, he decided the latest episode was another and stayed put. He suddenly filled his bed with diarrhea and was embarrassed beyond his ability to remain rational. In a complete loss of composure he jumped out of bed, gathered up the bed sheets, and threw them out the hospital window. A drunk was walking by the hospital when the sheets landed on him. He started yelling, cursing, and swinging his arms violently trying to get the unknown things off, and ended up with the soiled sheets in a tangled pile at his feet. As the drunk stood there, unsteady on his feet, staring down at the sheets, a hospital security guard, (barely containing his laughter), and who had watched the whole incident, walked up and asked, "What the heck is going on here?" The drunk, still staring down replied: "I think I just beat the shit out of a ghost."
Assimilation. Two Islamic men move to the U.S. and decide to get together for lunch. One says to the other, "Let's make a bet and see who can assimilate into the American culture faster. We'll meet up again in three months and compare our experiences." His Arab compatriot loves the idea, and agrees. When they meet up three months later, the first Arab says, "My boys play baseball and football, my wife is a member of the school PTA, we eat at McDonalds all the time and I love hot dogs! How about you, my friend?" The second Arab glares at him says, "Fuck you, Raghead."
So this guy buys a centipede from the pet store... he takes it home and sets it up in its aquarium, and lets it get settled in for a while. After a few hours the guy gets bored and goes up to the centipede and asks, "hey, centipede, you wanna go out and get a drink? check out the ladies? you know, just hang out?" But the centipede doesn't say anything. The guy thinks, "it must be getting used to its new environment or whatever," and he goes to bed. The next day after work, the guy's watching TV and he gets bored, so he goes up to the centipede again and taps on the aquarium glass, and says "HEY, centipede, you wanna go out, get a drink, maybe check out the ladies? Just hang out or whatever?" and the centipede doesn't say anything. The guys thinks, "that's weird, i wonder if it's sick or something. i'm not sure how centipedes are supposed to act i guess." and he shrugs it off and goes to bed. The third day, after work, the guy gets bored watching TV and goes to the centipede again, this time getting a little exasperated. "HEY! CENTIPEDE! Do you wanna go out and get a DRINK, check out the LADIES or something?" and the centipede yells back, "I heard you the first time man, I'm getting my shoes on!"
A traveling salesman... A traveling salesman couldn't find a hotel one night. He saw a light on a deserted road, and decided to knock on the door. It turned out to be a monastery; the monks were preparing dinner. He was invited to join the others while the food was being prepared. They sat round in a circle; each monk would recite a number and the others would laugh. Intrigued, the salesman spoke up. "What are you guys doing?" One of the elder monks replied, "We're telling jokes." "By saying numbers?" "Yes. You see, we've heard the jokes so many times, we have them catalogued. We don't need to tell the whole joke; we just refer to its number. Go ahead and try." The salesman thought for a second, and said, "78." The monks were in hysterics. Some were doubled over with laughter, others had tears rolling down their eyes, a few were pounding the table with their fists. When the laughter died down, the traveler asked, "Can you tell me what's so funny?" "We never heard that one before!"

Too Much to Drink It was getting late one night when the bartender at a pub decided he'd have to cut one of the regulars off. *"You've had too much to drink Jeffrey. I've got to stop servin' ya."* *"Aye, it seems I have. Besides, the wife's probably gonna be mad I drank too much again. I should get on home"* replied Jeffrey. At which point he tried to get up off his barstool, but immediately fell to the floor. ***SMACK*** After another attempt to get up, Jeffrey fell to the floor once more. ***SMACK*** *"Do ya need some help there Jeffrey?"* said the bartender. *"No no, I'll be fine. I only live across the road!"* responded Jeffrey as he crawled drunkenly across the pub floor. It took Jeffrey quite a while to get to the door of the pub. He tried to get up and walk once more, but he fell back to the ground just as hard. ***SMACK*** Eventually, after much struggle he made it across the street and into his apartment. The next day he woke up with a splitting headache, and it was clear is wife was not pleased. *"Ya got piss drunk again last night, didn't ya Jeffrey?!?"* she barked. Jeffrey sighed, and then responded *"Yes dear, I did. I'm so sorry! How did ya know?"* To which his wife snapped back *"The pub phoned this mornin'. Ya left yer damn wheelchair at the bar again!"*

A Visit to the Hospital (can be told long or short) A religious man walks into a hospital hoping to do a good deed by visiting the sick. The man has passed the nurse at the front desk and is looking around to find a sick person to cheer up. He looks all over the hospital but he just cant seem to find any sick person that isn't being visited! Finally the man comes to the end of a large hallway and sees a Chinese man laying in bed, hooked up to what seems to be thousands of wires, leads, and tubes, sitting all alone in his room watching TV. The man comes over to his bedside and begins to speak to the man. He is midway through his sentence when the man utters something in Chinese. "Ong Ching Pung" says the man in a calm tone. The visitor, who has never spoken a word of Chinese asks the man to clarify. "I'm sorry what? "Ong Ching Pung!" says the man a little louder this time. The visitor begins to panic as the Chinese man is now screaming and pleading with the same sentence over and over: "ONG CHING PUNG!!! ONG CHING PUNG!" "WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING?!" says the man. The Chinese man slumps over, as the various monitoring devices behind him begin to flash and ring, a team of doctors rushes in. The visitor leaves the hospital feeling horrible. Later that night he is eating in a Chinese restaurant, feeling terrible about the scene that had happened, just hours ago in the hospital. His waiter walks over to fill his water glass. "Pardon me," says the man to the waiter "But I was wondering if you speak any Chinese?" The waiter says "Yes, I grew up in China!". "I was wondering if you know what the phrase 'ong ching pung' means?" The waiter looks at him in a puzzled manner. "ong ching pung?" He thinks for a moment.  "It means don't stand on my oxygen tube."
So there was an abandoned church... and few nuns get sent over to clean it up a bit and restore its former glory. As they were painting the ceiling, one of them says, "Sisters, it is VERY hot in here, and we're working so feverishly, and i really don't want to get any paint on our robes. What say you, we just strip down, and finish this paint job in our birthday suits. This church has been abandoned for years, and even if somebody comes, we can always throw our robes back on in a second." The other nuns agree. A few minutes later there's a knock on the door. One of the nuns looks through the mail slot and sees a man standing there. So she says "Who is it?" and the man answers "I'm the blind man." Relieved the nun opens the door, and the man walks in and says "Nice hooters. Where do you want these blinds?"

Several days after the doctors appointment, the elderly couple are sat down watching television when the man asks, 'Margaret, would you mind making me a cup of tea?' 'Of course not', she replies. 'Don't forget to write it down, Margaret' the old man says 'You wouldn't want to forget it!' 'Don't be ridiculous! I won't forget a simple cup of tea!' she mutters, hobbling into the kitchen. 25 minutes later the elderly woman emerges from the kitchen carrying a full English breakfast. 'Here you go, Dear' the woman says, putting the meal on the mans lap. 'I knew you should have written it down!' the man chuckled 'You forgot the beans!'

Here's a joke about a cat One day a fish notices a fly buzzing a bit downstream just over the water. The fish thinks to itself "If I swim down river I'll be able to jump up and eat that fish for dinner." A bear also notices this fly and thinks to itself "If I wait near the river a fish will jump up and eat the fly and I'll reach out and grab the fish to eat for dinner." A hunter, camping by the river, notices the fly and the bear and thinks to himself "If that bear reaches out for a fish that will jump up to eat the fly I'll grab my gun and shoot the bear for my dinner." A mouse notices the hunter and the bear and thinks to itself "If the hunter grabs his gun to shoot the bear I'll run over and eat the sandwich that will fall out of his pocket for my dinner." A cat notices the mouse and the hunter and thinks to itself "If the mouse goes over to eat the hunter's sandwich I'll pounce on the mouse and eat it for my dinner." The fish swims downriver and jumps up to eat the fly, the bear grabs the fish, the hunter shoots the bear, the mouse eats the hunter's sandwich and the cat pounces and misses the mouse and falls into the river. TL;DR It takes a lot of foreplay to get a wet pussy

Old men think fast An elderly man in Louisiana had owned a large farm for several years. He had a large pond in the back. It was properly shaped for swimming, so he fixed it up nice with picnic tables, horseshoe courts, and some apple and peach trees. One evening the old farmer decided to go down to the pond, as he hadn't been there for a while, and look it over. He grabbed a five-gallon bucket to bring back some fruit. As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with glee. As he came closer, he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny-dipping in his pond. He made the women aware of his presence and they all went to the deep end. One of the women shouted to him, "We're not coming out until you leave!' The old man frowned, "I didn't come down here to watch you ladies swim naked or make you get out of the pond naked." Holding the bucket up he said, "I'm here to feed the alligator..."

You're the only white man we've ever seen and this woman gives birth to a white child. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what happened!" The professor replied, "No, Chief. You're mistaken. What you have here is a natural occurrence, what we in the civilized world call an albino! Look at that field over there. All of the sheep are white except for one black one. Nature does this on occasion." The chief was silent for a moment, then said, "Tell you what. You don't say anything more about that sheep and I won't say anything more about that white child.

The Bus Driver, and the Nun. A man gets onto a city bus and sees an attractive nun. Wanting to have sex with her, he goes up and asks, "Will you have sex with me?" "Of course not!" the nun said unnervingly and got off the bus. Before the depressed man left the bus, the bus driver stops him and says, "I know how you can screw her: On Sundays, she prays at the local cemetery. While she is praying, dress as God and she'll have sex with you. Put on a mask, robes, and a lot of glitter." That Sunday, the man takes the advice, gets into the costume and hides behind a gravestone. Shortly, the nun appears and prays. The man pops out from the gravestone and declares, "I am God, and I command you to have sex with me." The nun replies, "Sure, but only if we have anal sex." So they have anal sex. After sex the man rips off his mask and laughs, I'm not God! I'm that man from the bus! Ha!" Immediately the nun rips off her mask and says "Ha! I'm the bus driver!"

Interview With An 80 Year Old Lady The local news station was interviewing an 80-year-old lady because she had just gotten married for the fourth time. The interviewer asked her questions about her life, about what it is like to be marrying again at 80, and then about her new husband's occupation. "He's a funeral director," she answered. "Interesting," the newsman thought. He then asked her if she wouldn't mind telling him a little about her first three husbands and what they did for a living. She paused for a few moments, needing time to reflect on all those years. After a short time, a smile came to her face and she answered proudly, explaining that she'd first married a banker when she was in her early 20's, then a circus ringmaster when in her 40's, later on a preacher when in her 60's, and now in her 80's, a funeral director. The interviewer looked at her, quite astonished, and asked why she had married four men with such diverse careers. She smiled and explained, "I married one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, and four to go."

The 3 Construction Workers (really old joke, but one of my favorites when I was little) (Sorry if this has been posted before, I only subscribed recently and haven't seen this one yet) There are three construction workers: Joe, Bob, and Frank. One day they are sitting on an I-beam high above their construction site. It is lunch hour and the three have their lunchboxes, ready to eat lunch. Joe opens his lunchbox and, with a look of disgust, pulls out a burger. "UGH," he says, "I am SO sick of burgers! Every single day my wife packs me lunch, and every single day it's a burger. I swear, I'm so fed up with burgers that if I have to eat one or lunch one more day, I'll throw myself off this beam." Bob goes next, and pulls out a thermos of soup. "I know exactly how you feel buddy," he says angrily. "My wife insists on packing soup for me EVERY SINGLE DAY. This is at least the tenth day in a row! If I have to eat soup for lunch one more time, I'll jump off of here too." Frank opens his lunchbox and finds a cheese sandwich. "I'm right there with you guys. Every day, it's a cheese sandwich. I can't take the same old thing anymore! If I have to have one more, I'll jump off with you guys." The next day, they are sitting on the same beam together eating lunch. Joe opens his lunchbox and finds a burger; so, true to his word, he leaps from the I-beam and dies. Next, Bob opens his lunchbox and finds a thermos of soup, so he jumps as well and dies. Last, Frank opens his and finds a cheese sandwich, so, like his friends, as jumps to his death. The three were very close friends, so their families decide to have a joint funeral. Joe's wife is completely broken down and in hysterics. "I had no idea! I didn't!" she cried. "If only I had known how much he hated burgers, I would've just given him something else!" Bob's wife is in a similar state. She says between sobs, "I feel exactly the same. I thought he loved the soup I gave him. If I had known the truth, I would have given him something else!" Frank's wife, unlike the other two, surprisingly does not look too upset, but instead simply exasperated. Everyone at the funeral looks to her, expecting to hear something similar to the other two. She looks around at everyone and says, "Don't look at me, the idiot packed his *own* lunch every day!"

Don't Bullshit Your Mother Mrs. Rabin comes to visit her son Bernie for dinner. He lives with a female roommate, Elaine. During the course of the meal, his mother couldn't help but notice how pretty Bernie's roommate is. Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between Bernie and his roommate than met the eye. Reading his mom's thoughts, Bernie volunteered, "I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Elaine and I are just roommates.'' About a week later, Elaine came to Bernie saying, "Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the silver sugar bowl. You don't suppose she took it, do you?" "Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure." So he sat down and wrote an email: *Dear Mom I'm not saying that you "did" take the sugar bowl from my house ; I'm not saying that you "did not" take it. But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner. Your Loving Son Bernie* Several days later, Bernie received a response email from his Mom which read: *Dear son, I'm not saying that you "do" sleep with Elaine, and I'm not saying that you "do not" sleep with her. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found the sugar bowl by now. Your Loving Mother*

Peanut One evening a man was at home watching TV and eating peanuts. He'd toss them in the air, and then catch them in his mouth In the middle of catching one, his wife asked him a question - and as he turned to answer her, a peanut fell in his ear. He tried and tried to dig it out but succeeded in only pushing it in deeper. He called his wife for assistance, and after hours of trying they became worried and decided to go to the hospital. As they were ready to go out the door, their daughter came home with her date. After being informed of the problem, their daughter's date said he could get the peanut out.. The young man told the father to sit down, then proceeded to shove two fingers up the father's nose and told him to blow hard. When the father blew, the peanut flew out of his ear. The mother and daughter jumped and yelled for joy. The young man insisted that it was nothing. Once he was gone, the mother turned to the father and said, 'That's so wonderful! Isn't he smart? What do you think he's going to be when he grows older?' The father replied, 'From the smell of his fingers, our son-in-law.

Three explorers are on a remote island... ...and are captured by a tribe of natives. The chief walks up and says, "I've got bad news for you, guys. We're cannibals, so you're all going to be dinner tonight." He points to a huge cauldron of boiling water. The explorers are horrified, and start begging for their lives. "I know we seem primitive," says the chief. "But we don't have many options here. There's no animals, the soil is poor--we have no choice, for our tribe to survive. Be assured that nothing goes to waste--we make simple tools like forks and knives out of your bones, clothes with your hair--we even use your skin for our canoes." Rather than feeling consoled, the men start screaming. "Okay, look," says the chief. "To show you how bad I feel about the whole thing, I'll grant you each one final wish. What would you like?" The first and second explorer are so shocked, the only thing they can think of is a last cigarette. The chief replies that they still have half a pack from their last victims, and gives each a smoke. After they finish, they're both thrown into the cauldron. Turning to the third man, the chief asks, "and what would you like?" "I'd like a fork," says the explorer. "A fork? For your last request on this earth? Are you sure?" "You heard me...give me a goddamn fork." The chief shrugs, obliges, and hands him a fork. The man immediately starts stabbing himself viciously, all over his body. The chief, a bit taken back, asks, "What do you think you're doing?" The explorer yells, "Fuck your canoe!"

A Jew and his Rabbi. A Jewish man, concerned with recent developments, goes to his Rabbi to ask him a question: "Rabbi, I grow concerned; My child went away to college, and now that he's come home for the holidays, he's returned as a Christian." "Really?" Replies the Rabbi, "That's odd, because my child also went away to college, and he's also returned as a Christian." The two men both decide it's best to ask God himself and decide to pray together to find answers to their questions. "God, why is it now that both of our children left their homes, they've suddenly decided to become Christians?" God thought about this for a bit, then replied, "You know... it's funny you say that."

TV shopping. Mary Sue, a young woman with notable blonde hair, decided that she needed a new TV for her bedroom. So she goes down to the local applience store and looks around before poking the nearest salesman in the shoulder. "Excuse me sir, I'd like to ask you a few questions about that TV." The man looked the woman up and down and smiled before shaking his head. "I'm sorry miss, but I don't sell TV's to dumb blondes." He snorted before walking off. Annoyed but not beaten, Mary went home and died her hair the darkest shade of black she could, and returned the next day and walked straight up to the manager again. "Excuse me sir, I'd like to ask you a few questions about that TV on the shelf." The manager gave the woman another look and shook his head again. "I'm sorry miss, but I don't sell TVs to dumb blondes." He replied again and went back to the break room. Mary, now furious that she had been stumped twice by the man, went home and shaved her head bare till she didn't even have a stubble of hair. The next day, bald headed Mary strode into the store and crossed her arms infront of the manager. "SIR, I'd like to buy that TV over there." She told him in a firm voice. The man, smiling at the shine of her head, could only shake his head from side to side. "I'm sorry miss, but I don't sell TVs to dumb blondes." Mary was beyond herself now, and would have tore out her hair if she had any left. "HOW?! How do you know I'm a blonde?" She begged the man. "Well for starters, Miss, that is Microwave."
Pope VS. Mufti Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all Muslims had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Muslim community, so the Pope offered a deal.He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Muslim community. If the Muslims won, they could stay in Italy; and if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave. The Muslim people met and picked an aged and wise Mufti to represent them in the debate.However, as the Mufti spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Arabic, they agreed that it would be a "silent" debate.On the chosen day the Pope and Mufti sat opposite each other.The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Mufti looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head.The Mufti pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Mufti pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Moulana was too clever.The Muslims could stay in Italy.Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened.The Pope said, "First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity."He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God!"Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us."He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us."I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins."He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin."He beat me at every move and I could not continue!"Meanwhile, the Muslim community gathered to ask the Mufti how he'd won."I haven't a clue," the Mufti said."First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger."Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Muslims and I told him that we were staying right here!""And then what?" asked a woman."Who knows?" said the Mufti. "He took out his lunch so I took out mine."

Geriatric sex. An old man and old woman met after both became residents at a retirement home. They began to get pretty friendly, and really enjoyed each others company. After about 3 weeks of getting to know each other, the old man said to the woman, "I know we are both old and can't do much sexually anymore, but if I pulled out my penis, would you hold it?" The woman did not see what that would hurt, so she said she would. Every day for the next month the couple would sit in the park by the lake and the old woman would hold the man's penis. One day the man didn't show up at their regular meeting place. The woman became concerned and set out to search for him. Further down the shore she spotted him sitting on a bench, with another woman beside him. She walked up to the bench to find his penis in the other woman's hand. This upset her very much and she yelled at the old man: "We have been together for 2 months now, I thought we were getting along just fine. Now I find you here with this other woman. What does she have that I don't?" "Parkinson's!"

A Bee in her Vagina One day a young man and woman were in their bedroom making love. All of a sudden a bumblebee entered the bedroom window. As the young lady parted her legs the bee entered her vagina. The woman started screaming "Oh my God, help me, there's a bee in my vagina!" The husband immediately took her to the local doctor and explained the situation. The doctor thought for a moment and said "Hmm, tricky situation. But I have a solution to the problem if young sir would permit." The husband being very concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina. The doctor said "OK, what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my penis I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina. The husband nodded and gave his approval. The young lady said "Yes, Yes, whatever, just get on with it." So the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey, inserted it into the young lady's vagina. After a few gentle strokes, the doctor said, "I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper." So the doctor went deeper and deeper. After a while the doctor began shafting the young lady very hard indeed. The young lady began to quiver with excitement. She began to moan and groan aloud. The doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was enjoying himself, he then put his hands on the young lady's breasts and started making loud noises. The husband at this point suddenly became very annoyed and shouted, "Now wait a minute! What the Hell do you think you're doing?" The doctor, still concentrating, replied, "Change of plan. I'm gonna drown the bastard!"

I went into our apartment building and up to the 29th floor where we live, and I burst through the door and headed towards our bedroom. I could hear some noises being made, but by the time I flung open our bedroom door all I saw was my naked and sweaty wife. I started screaming at her and I tore open the closet doors and looked under the bed, but I couldn't find anyone else. I was just about to give up when I suddenly heard a noise out on our balcony. I went out there and sure enough, there was a naked guy dangling from our ledge, 29 stories up. I was so mad that I started punching and kicking him, but he held on so I went back inside, grabbed a hammer, and smashed his fingers. He let go and plunged down all 29 flights, but the lucky sonofab*tch managed to hit the awning outside our building and bounce into the bushes. At this point I was so mad that I rushed into our kitchen, ripped the refrigerator out of the wall, dragged it onto the balcony and threw it down on top of him. It did the trick, but all that exertion got to me and I had a massive heart attack, and well, here I am." St. Peter says, "Yeah, that's a hard luck story all right. Go ahead and go on in." The next guy comes to the line and St. Peter says, "OK, give me your hard luck story." The guy tells him: "Well, I live on the 30th floor of an apartment building and I like to sunbathe nude on my balcony in the afternoon. I was out there today catching some rays when I suddenly heard a great commotion going on one floor below. I went to the end of my balcony and peered down over the railing, but I slipped and tumbled over it and started to fall down. Luckily, I managed to catch myself on the ledge one floor below, and suddenly a guy came out. I figured he would help me, but instead he starts punching and kicking me. I held on with all my might, but he eventually got a hammer and smashed my fingers, so I let go and fell down to the bottom. I must have hit our building's awning and bounced into the bushes, by the grace of god I was still alive! I was just regaining my senses when I looked up the last thing I saw was this giant refrigerator falling down on me, and well, here I am." "Yep," St. Peter says, "that's a hard luck story alright. Come on in." A third guy approaches and St. Peter says, "You know the drill. Tell me your hard luck story." To this the guy responds: "Picture this. You're scared and cold and you're hiding naked in this refrigerator. . ."

Marx as a Student In University, Karl Marx's Political Economics professor noted that every day, the young man would get up halfway through class and walk out, which caused a good deal of disruption. The professor quickly grew tired of the daily distraction, and so one day, as Marx stood up and prepared to leave, the professor stopped lecturing and turned to him. "I am curious, Mr. Marx, what it is about my teaching you find so intolerable that you cannot sit through more than half of any given lecture." Karl looked surprised for a moment, but quickly understood what the problem was, and said, "Oh, no, sir, it's nothing like that. See, I have a class on "Proletariat ideology" that starts in five minutes, and I'll be dropped from the course if I'm late." The professor was confused. "You mean to tell me that the University registered you for two courses during the same time?" "Yes, sir," Marx responded. "So it's nothing personal. Just a class conflict."

Redneck logic Two rednecks decided that they weren't going anywhere in life and thought they should go to college to get ahead. The first went in to see the counselor, who told him to take math, history, and logic. "What's logic?" the first redneck asked. The professor answered, "Let me give you an example. Do you own a weed eater?" "I sure do." "Then I can assume, using logic, that you have a yard," replied the professor. "That's real good!" said the redneck. The professor continued, "Logic will also tell me that since you have a yard, you also own a house." Impressed, the redneck said, "Amazing!" "And since you own a house, logic dictates that you have a wife." "That's Betty Mae! This is incredible!" The redneck was catching on. "Finally, since you have a wife, logically I can assume that you are heterosexual," said the professor. "You're absolutely right! Why that's the most fascinatin' thing I ever heard! I cain't wait to take that logic class!" The redneck, proud of the new world opening up to him, walked back into the hallway where his friend was still waiting. "So what classes are ya takin'?" asked the friend. "Math, history, and logic!" replied the first redneck. "What in tarnation is logic?" asked his friend. "Let me give you an example. Do ya own a weed eater?" asked the first redneck. "No," his friend replied. "You're queer, ain't ya?"

A joke that my friend told me. So there once was this wasp that lived in a jungle. This was not your ordinary wasp, though--he was smart, philosophical even. One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with flying colors. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This, too, proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean's list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in--the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him. He goes on to get two PhD's, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the Presidential election was coming up, and the wasp decides he might as well go for it. Of course, he wins in the largest landslide in US Presidential history. His Presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was re-elected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp's departure, but they all know it's what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn't been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there's an extremely long line. He decides it's worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he's ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it's not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there's no punch line.
Ten pound baby There was a baby born in the hospital and he weighed ten pounds. The odd thing about him was his body weighed five pounds and his balls weighed five pounds. All the nurses and even the doctor didn't know what to do with him. Then, the chief surgeon walked in and asked what was wrong. The head nurse replied, "We don't know what to do with this baby." So the chief surgeon took one look and said, "You should put him into a mental institution." "Why?' asked the head nurse. "Well," replied the chief surgeon, "take a look at him. The boy is obviously half nuts."

A Parrot with an attitude A young man named John received a parrot as a gift. The parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary. Every word out of the bird's mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity. John tried and tried to change the bird's attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think of to "clean up" the bird's vocabulary. Finally, John was fed up and he yelled at the parrot. The parrot yelled back. John shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even ruder. John, in desperation, threw up his hand, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer. For a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed. Then suddenly there was total quiet. Not a peep was heard for over a minute. Fearing that he'd hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to the freezer. The parrot calmly stepped out onto John's outstretched arms and said "I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I'm sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior." John was stunned at the change in the bird's attitude. As he was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, the bird continued, "May I ask what the turkey did?"

In the shark-infested waters of the Caribbean... ...two prawns called Justin and Christian are discussing the pressures of being a preyed-upon prawn. "I hate being a prawn," says Justin.

So when he bumps into the cod again, he begs the mysterious fish to change him back. Lo and behold, Justin is turned back into a prawn. With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes, he swims back to the reef to seek out Christian. As he approaches, he shouts out: "It's me, Justin, your old friend. I've changed... I've found Cod. I'm a prawn again, Christian."

Wikipedia told me a joke today. A woman gets on a bus with her baby. The bus driver says: "That's the ugliest baby that I've ever seen. Ugh!" The woman goes to the rear of the bus and sits down, fuming. She says to a man next to her: "The driver just insulted me!" The man says: "You go right up there and tell him off  go ahead, I'll hold your monkey for you." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World's_funniest_joke
The mini skirt. In a crowded city at a crowded bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt with matching tight leather boots and jacket. As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver she reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again she tried to make the step onto the bus only to discover she still couldn't! So, a little more embarrassed she once again reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. So, with a coy little smile to the driver she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step. About this time the big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him "How dare you touch my body!! I don't even know who you are!" At this the Texan drawled "Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends."

The hamster and the man. A friend told me this joke as a child and it still makes me laugh because of its absurdity. A man was watching TV at his home when he suddenly heard a knock on his door. At the door was a tiny little hamster, all soaked up because of the pouring rain. The hamster said, "Lemme in!" The man ignored the hamster and closed the door. The hamster didn't give up. He knocked on the man's door again. When the man opened the door, the hamster shouted again, "Lemme in!" The man was seemingly getting frustrated and he yelled, "Get the fuck out!" and closed the door again. So the hamster knocked again. This time the man got angry and asked, "What the hell is it that you want!?" The hamster replied, "I would just like to get inside." The man relented and said, "Oh. Come on in. I thought you said 'lemming'."

The Special Two buddies are out at a bar swapping stories and getting wasted. Just as last call is signaled, one of them remarks to the other, "You know, Jon, its been a long time since I really gave it to a woman. I mean, just really let her have it, you know?" He pounded his fist into his palm lightly at this last part for emphasis. His friend immediately threw his arms out with excitement and exclaimed, "Rob, oh my God! I have the PERFECT solution! There's a place I know, it's pretty far out there, off of Route 87. Head out there, its this enormous mansion, and head in to the front desk. Tell them I sent you and ask for 'The Special'! Trust me, it's AMAZING!" Rob immediately downed his last shot and replied, "Yeah, alright! I'll go out there now!" He grabbed his keys, jumped in his car, and sped off towards the county back roads. He found his way to Route 87 and, after driving all night for several hours, came across the manor. He stared at the imposing, three-story Victorian through his car window before getting out and walking in the front door. There before him was a long desk similar to what could be seen at a motel and some middle-aged guy leaning on it reading over a magazine. He approached the desk and said, "Hey, my friend Jon sent me. Told me to ask for 'The Special'?" The guy absently looked up and replied, "Huh? Oh, ohh! Okay, yeah, it's down this hall, last door on the right." Rob walked past the front desk, down the main hall, and went through the door he was directed to. The room was incredibly dark, with the exception of the moonlight streaming through the window. By the window, he could see a bed situated with a beautiful woman spread wide before him. He could tell she was very attractive, but she was also just laying there, spread open and ready. He thought to himself, "Well this is weird. But what the hell, she sure looks hot!" So he jumps on, strips off, and, after some careful maneuvering, finds where to make his mark. He's really getting into it, slapping her ass, pulling her hair, moaning and groaning loudly. And she's just...laying there silently, not even so much as moving. He doesn't mind this at all, and, in fact, it only serves to heighten his mood. Finally, he feels himself getting close, so he slams into her hips and cums for all he's worth. As he's hit by his mind-blowing orgasm he notices something weird happening to the woman. It's almost as if her face is starting to liquefy or like something is oozing out of it. He freaks out so badly that he immediately screams and bursts out of the room, running down the hall stark naked to the front desk. He starts ranting and raving to the guy there, "You've got to help! That lady, something's wrong with her! Her face, its oozing or some crap! It's like turning into some sort of..goo!" The guy absently looks up from his magazine again and replies, "Huh? What? Ohh..oh! Oh, right, okay, yeah. Don't worry, we'll take care of this." He turns his head to the room behind the desk and yells, "HEY LENNY! THE DEAD ONE'S FULL AGAIN!"

A doctor is delivering a baby. The mother had been in labor for close to 36 hours, and she's near exhaustion. The doctor looks up and says, "one more good push and we should be good to go." The mother musters all of her strength and manages one last push. Because the baby is wet and slippery with amniotic fluid, she slips all the way out and the doctor drops her. Quickly, the doctor scoops her up, but she isn't moving. So the doctor gently shakes the baby. Nothing happens so he shakes her a little harder. Again nothing happens so he shakes the baby violently, still nothing happens. The doctor then slaps the baby around and then in desperation he throws the baby across the delivery room. The baby hits the wall behind the mother and slowly slides down the wall. At this point the mother is horrified and is understandably she is freaking out, "OH MY GOD! WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY BABY!?!?!?!" The doctor walks over to the baby, picks her up, hands her to the mother and says, "I'm just kidding it was dead when it came out."

A man walks into a bar... And orders a Jack &amp; Coke. The bartender says "Comin' right up man." He reaches under the bar and gives the man an apple. "What the hell is this?" the man asks. "Just take a Bite." Says the bartender. The man is skeptical, but takes a bite. He is astonished to find that the apple tastes like Jack Daniels. The bartender says "turn it around and bite the other side." The man bites the other side and sure enough, it tastes like coke! When asked how he did it the bartender replies "That's a trade secret." A short while later another guy walks into the bar. He orders a Gin &amp; tonic. The bartender reaches under the bar and gives the second man an apple. The second man asks "Hey man, what the hell? I said Gin and tonic!" The first man says "Just trust him. Take a bite!" The second man takes a bite and sure enough, the apple tastes like gin. "Turn it around and bite the other side." The bartender says. The second man takes a bite from the other side and sure enough it tastes like Tonic! A short while later, a midget walks into the bar and sits right by the two men. The first man says "Hey, buddy. before you order you should know, this bartender is a wizard or something. Whatever you order, he'll give you an apple that tastes like what you wanted! It's amazing!" The midget ponders the man's claim, then asks the bartender "Hey, you got an apple that tastes like pussy?" "Sure do." Replies the bartender. He hands the midget his apple and he takes a bite. "EEEWWW GROSS!!" The midget says "This apple tastes like shit!!!" The bartender chuckles and says "Turn it around."

Do you have a Category for LONGEST Joke? (ok maybe it's not a "joke", but it sure is funny) If you can read this whole story without laughing then there's no hope for you. I was crying by the end. Note: Please take time to read this slowly. If you pay attention to the first two judges, the reaction of the third judge is even better. For those of you who have lived in Texas , you know how true this is. They actually have a Chili Cook-off about the time Halloween comes around. It takes up a major portion of a parking lot at the San Antonio City Park . Judge #3 was an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank, who was visiting from Springfield , IL . Frank: "Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking for directions to the Coors Light truck, when the call came in. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy and, besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted". Here are the scorecard notes from the event: CHILI # 1 - MIKE'S MANIAC MONSTER CHILI... Judge # 1 -- A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick. Judge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild. Judge # 3 (Frank) -- Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy. CHILI # 2 - AUSTIN 'S AFTERBURNER CHILI... Judge # 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang. Judge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously. Judge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face. CHILI # 3 - FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI... Judge # 1 -- Excellent firehouse chili. Great kick. Judge # 2 -- A bit salty, good use of peppers. Judge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all of the beer. CHILI # 4 - BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC... Judge # 1 -- Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing. Judge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili. Judge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the beermaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. That 300-LB woman is starting to look HOT...just like this nuclear waste I'm eating! Is chili an aphrodisiac? CHILI # 5 LISA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER... Judge # 1 -- Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive. Judge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement. Judge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks. CHILI # 6 - VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY... Judge # 1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers. Judge # 2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb. Judge # 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I shit on myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone. CHILI # 7 - SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI.. Judge # 1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers. Judge # 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. **I should take note that I am worried about Judge # 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably. Judge # 3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing it's too painful. Screw it; I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach. CHILI # 8 - BIG TOM'S TOENAIL CURLING CHILI... Judge # 1 -- The perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence. Judge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 farted, passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. poor feller, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili? Judge # 3 - No Report

Dumbest kid in the world. A young boy enters a barber shop and the barber whispers to his customer, "This is the dumbest kid in the world. Watch while I prove it to you." The barber puts a dollar bill in one hand and two quarters in the other, then calls the boy over and asks, "Which do you want, son?" The boy takes the quarters and leaves. "What did I tell you?" said the barber. "That kid never learns!" Later, when the customer leaves, he sees the same young boy coming out of the ice cream store. "Hey, son! May I ask you a question? Why did you take the quarters instead of the dollar bill?" The boy licked his cone and replied, "Because the day I take the dollar, the game is over!"
Lethal Food A dietician was once addressing a large audience in Chicago. "The material we put into our stomachs is enough to have killed most of us sitting here, years ago. Red meat is awful. Vegetables can be disastrous, and none of us realises the germs in our drinking water. But there is one thing that is the most dangerous of all and we all eat it. Can anyone here tell me what lethal product I'm referring to?" "You, sir, in the first row, please give us your idea." The man lowered his head and said, "Wedding cake."
U2 has a concert... and at the end of one of the songs, Bono takes off his guitar, places it on the ground and slowly walks up to the mic. He asks the crowd to be silent for a moment, the crowd immediately quiets down. After a few seconds, Bono claps. Another couple of seconds pass and Bono claps again. He does this for about a minute then he pauses and says, "Everytime I clap, a child in Africa dies of AIDS." Bono claps one more time then someone from the crowd yells out, "Well then stop clapping you fucking asshole!"

Little Johnny. A kindergarten teacher told her students she was going to recite the alphabet and ask them to give her a word that begins with each letter. She began..."A". A few students raised their hands, including Little Johnny. The teacher thought to herself "I can't call on Little Johnny for the answer, he'll surely say something naughty like 'ass'." So she calls on Little Christy. "Apple", says Little Christy. "Very good" said the teacher. She proceeded..."B". Again Little Johnny was one of the students that raised their hands. The teacher thought to herself "I can't call on Little Johnny for the answer, he'll surely say something naughty like 'bitch'." So she calls on Little Kenny. "Banana", says Little Kenny. "Very good" said the teacher. The teacher continues through the entire alphabet, ignoring Little Johnny through all of the letters. She finally gets to the letter "R". She thinks about it and decides there are no dirty words that begin with "R", so it should be safe to call on Little Johnny for the answer. "Rat" says Little Johnny. "Very good" said the teacher. Then Little Johnny holds up his hands and says "With a dick this long."

Game 7 It's Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final, and a man makes his way to his seat right at center ice. He sits down, noticing that the seat next to him is empty. He leans over and asks his neighbor if someone will be sitting there. "No" says the neighbor. "The seat is empty." "This is incredible," said the man. "Who in their right mind would have a seat like this for the Stanley Cup and not use it?" The neighbor says, "Well, actually, the seat belongs to me. I was supposed to come with my wife, but she passed away. This is the first Stanley Cup we haven't been to together since we got married." "Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. That's terrible... But couldn't you find someone else, a friend or relative, or even a neighbor to take the seat?" The man shakes his head. "No," he says. "They're all at the funeral."

Three Europeans wash ashore on an island occupied by cannibals... They are caught quickly, and the cannibal chief tells them that they are to be eaten and their skins used to make canoes. They are horrified at the thought of being cooked or eaten alive, but at least a little of their fear is relieved when the chief tells them that they will be permitted to kill themselves in a manner of their own choosing. The first, an Englishman, elects to shoot himself and asks for a pistol. He is presented with one, and says farewell to his friends before ending it. The second, a Frenchman, asks for poison. He turns to the other, says "au revoir," and drinks the poison, dying shortly. The third, a Pole, asks for a fork. The chief is confused, but hands him one anyway. The Pole proceeds to stab himself an excessive number of times all over his body, drawing copious amounts of blood and astonishing and even disturbing the onlooking cannibals somewhat. The chief grabs hold of him and asks him why he would make himself suffer so. The Pole says, "I can't stop you from eating me, but it looks like you're going to be short one canoe."
Grandpa told me this A man was sitting in a bar and noticed a group of people using sign language. He also noticed that the bartender was using sign language to speak to them. When the bartender returned to him, the man asked how he had learned to use sign language. The bartender explained that these were regular customers and had taught him to speak in sign. The man thought that was great. A few minutes later the man noticed that the people in the group were waving their hands around very wildly. The bartender looked over and signed "Now cut that out! I warned you!" and threw the group out of the bar. The man asked why he had done that and the bartender said, "If I told them once I told them 100 times - NO SINGING IN THE BAR!"

An old jewish man was walking down the street... An old jewish man was walking down the street, looking through the shop windows, mumbling for himself that there isn't really anything he could see that he would ever consider spending his hard earned money on. Suddenly, the old man spots an breathtakingly attractive young woman walking in front of him. The lovely peach shaped ass makes the old man drop his jaw and he decides to catch up with her so he can get a glimpse of the front of her as well. When he manages to stop her and he gets a glimpse of her front he stands speechless for seconds. Her beautiful face and the most amazing perky breasts you've ever seen forces the old man to come up with a plan. He tells the young lady that, "*Sweetheart, if you allow me to bite your beautiful supple round breasts, I will give you $10!*". The young lady just looks at the old man with a blank stare and with a very offended tone in her voice she manages to get out, "*Are you crazy? Creepy old man, of course you can't. $10 is nothing and the last thing I want is for you to bite my breasts.*" With an upset look on her face the storms off in the direction she was heading to leave the old man standing there back at square one. Although, he is not one to give in easy so he decides to run around the block and waits for her in the next crossing. As soon as she sees him she starts getting upset again but she still allows him to speak his mind. The old man starts like he did in the previous crossing, "*Sweetheart, if you allow me to bite your amazing breasts, I will give you $500! That's a lot of money for a young lady like yourself, is it not?*". The young lady, who still is very offended replies, "*Of course it's a lot of money but it's faar from enough for me to let some old hairy man bite my breasts. It's still a no go, so please leave me alone*". The old man respects her decline and steps to the side so that she can keep on walking down the road. But when he stands there watching her walk away he realizes that he can't let her go just yet so he decides to run around the next block, for the last time. When they meet up in the next crossing the woman starts getting pissed off and tells the old man to leave her alone, she even threatens to call the police. That's when the old man quickly blurts out, "*I'm sorry sweetheart, what if I can bite your breasts for $10,000?! At least I know that that's a lot of money.*" The young woman is kind of speechless as it sure is a lot of money and calms down a bit, "*Well, you are right, I really could use that money. Oh what the heck, I'll let you do it. Just not out here in the road, let's go into the alley*". The old man follows the young lady into the back alley and she wips out her twins. They are just as the old man imagined. With a perfectly round shape and size, very perky and very supple, these were, hands down, the most amazing breasts the old man had seen in all of his life. He started caressing them, sucking on them, motor-boating them, squeezing them, essentially worshiping the wonderful creation in front of him. After a few minutes of the old man's playing around the young lady started getting a confused look on her face and asks, "*Are you not going to bite them?*", and the old man replies, "*Oh, no.* *That would be waaaaaaay too expensive.*" Edit: Added quotation marks for clarification.

Dog sitting A dog lover, whose dog was a female and in heat, agreed to look after her neighbours' male dog while the neighbours were on vacation. She had a large house and believed that she could keep the two dogs apart. However, as she was drifting off to sleep she heard awful howling and moaning sounds. She rushed downstairs and found the dogs locked together in obvious pain and unable to disengage, as so frequently happens when dogs mate. Unable to separate them, and perplexed as to what to do next, although it was late, she called the vet, who answered in a very grumpy voice. After she explained the problem to him, the vet said, "Hang up the phone and place it down alongside the dogs." "I will then call you back and the noise of the ringing will make the male lose his erection and he will be able to withdraw." "Do you think that will work?" she asked. "It just worked for me," he replied. **Edit** Never thought I'd make front page! Now I can validate that I'm funny!!

A knock at the door Every day, Jim gets two six packs on the way home from work. When he gets home, he sits in his living room until they're gone. One day, just as he's getting to the end of the last beer, he hears a knock at the door. He goes to answer it, and sees a six foot tall grasshopper. Before he can say a word, the grasshopper punches him in the face as hard as he's ever been hit! Floored, he can't respond before the grasshopper leaves. He decides he'd better be in better shape, so the next day he only gets one six pack. Just as he's finishing the last beer, he hears another knock at the door. He gets up to answer it, a bit more wary this time. Not that it does him any good. The six foot tall grasshopper is there again, and this time hits him *twice*, each one as hard as he's ever been hit! Again, the grasshopper leaves before he can do anything. On the third day, he decides he'd better just skip his beer. He's sitting in his living room, stone cold sober, when he hears a knock at the door. He checks his peephole. It's the grasshopper. But he figures this time he hasn't been drinking and he can take him, so he opens the door. Before he can do anything, the grasshopper knocks him down and kicks him until he can't move. Again, the grasshopper leaves when it's done. Obviously he's in bad shape after that, so he goes in to see his doctor. He describes what's been going on. The doctor nods knowingly, "Yeah, there's been a pretty nasty bug going around."

skipping church Father Norton woke up Sunday morning and realizing it was an exceptionally beautiful and sunny early spring day, decided he just had to play golf. So... he told the Associate Pastor that he was feeling sick and persuaded him to say Mass for him that day. As soon as the Associate Pastor left the room, Father Norton headed out of town to a golf course about forty miles away. This way he knew he wouldn't accidentally meet anyone he knew from his parish. Setting up on the first tee, he was alone. After all, it was Sunday morning and everyone else was in church! At about this time, Saint Peter leaned over to the Lord while looking down from the heavens and exclaimed "You're not going to let him get away with this, are you?" The Lord sighed, and said, "No, I guess not." Just then Father Norton hit the ball and it shot straight towards the pin, dropping just short of it, rolled up and fell into the hole. IT WAS A 420 YARD HOLE IN ONE! St. Peter was astonished. He looked at the Lord and asked, "Why did you let him do that?" The Lord smiled and replied, "Who's he going to tell?"
Dog Hunter Two old friends get together once a year to go hunting. It's something they look forward to every year and it is the foundation of their decades-long friendship. One year, one of the friends brings a hunting dog that he had just bought. He said to his friend, "Watch - he'll go out to the woods, and when he comes back, he'll tell us exactly how many ducks are out there for us to shoot!" The other man doesn't believe it. But sure enough, the dog is sent out, and he runs into the woods. About twenty minutes later the dog comes back and barks: "woof, woof, woof..." for a total of twelve times. The men count along with the dog, and they all go out into the woods. Sure enough, there are exactly 12 ducks in the pond. "Amazing!" The other man exclaims. The following year, the other man decides that he wants a duck-counting hunting dog too. So he goes to the store and the clerk assures him that this dog will do the exact same thing he saw his friend's dog do the previous year. So the two men meet again to hunt, and the other man with his new dog sends him out to the woods to count the ducks. About thirty minutes later, the dog comes running back to the men, holding a large tree branch in his mouth, and lunges at his owner and begins furiously humping the man's leg while his head shakes back and forth repeatedly. The annoyed man takes the defective dog back to the store and complains to the owner. When he told the owner that the dog didn't count the ducks, but instead came running back with a stick in his mouth, began humping the man's leg and moving his head around, the owner laughs and says, "There's nothing wrong with the dog! "He was just trying to tell you that there are more fucking ducks out there than you can shake a stick at!"

Making Cakes - from a friend Little Suzie, who is four, and her mom were walking through the park when then happened to come upon two teenages having sex in grass. "Mommy, what are they doing?!" asked little Suzie. Her mother replied, "Making cakes, honey." Suzie didn't think or say anything else about it until a few days later at the zoo. Suzie sees two lions having sex and says to her mother, "Mommy! Those lions are making cakes!" Her mother replied, "Yes, dear, they are."

A female drifter I'm a drifter, a woman, and you don't find that much, especially in England. I run a scam pretending to be a nanny. Too recently, I had to eliminate some competition for the job. I got in, and got in real good with the parents. Scared the kids. I gave them LSD and forced them to consort with a schizophrenic tea-shop owner and a crazy hobo and his gang. I intentionally got the father fired from his job because of a political disagreement, and ran off before blame could be cast on me. My name is Mary, Mary Poppins.

There is the story of a statistician who told a friend that he never took airplanes: "I have computed the probability that there will be a bomb on the plane," he explained, "and although this probability is low, it is still too high for my comfort. " Two weeks later, the friend met the statistician on a plane. "How come you changed your theory?" he asked. "Oh, I didn't change my theory; it's just that I subsequently computed the probability that there would simultaneously be two bombs on a plane. This probability is low enough for my comfort. So now I simply carry my own bomb. "

"Well, have you been tested for any STDs?" "Yes - all the results were clear, so that can't be it." "Have you been exposed to any unusual chemicals or dyes?" "No, nothing like that..."

A bar contest goes awry A businessman from out of town comes across a secluded bar on the outskirts of the city he's visiting, so he stops in for a drink. While at the bar he notices a large a shot glass the size of a water bucket filled with twenty dollar bills. Curious, the man motions for the bartender, "What's the story with that shot glass?" "Oh, that's just a little in-house contest we started years ago, but nobody's ever won it before." "Well, what's the contest?" "It's a $20 entry fee, but after that you have three tasks." The bartender points over to the bouncer: a large man stuffed into a designer suit, his face and hands are covered in scars and tattoos, "You're first task is to knockout our bouncer who just so happens to be a former mercenary." "Okay," the man says after sipping on his martini. "Your second task is outside. You hear that howling and barking outside?" "Yeah..." "That's our guard dog: an old German Shepherd used by the local PD, but it's gotta bad tooth and you've got to take it out." "What's the final challenge?" The bartender points to an elderly woman sitting at the far end of the bar, "Her: she's a 89 year-old virgin, you have to take her virginity." The customer stares at the bartender for a bit, "Let me think about it." A few hours and martinis later the customer flags down the bartender, "I'm in." The customer slaps down $20, races over to the bouncer and breaks a chair over his head. Before the bouncer can get up the customer slams the bouncer's head into the door -- the bouncer falls silent. The customer rushes outside where the next few minutes are filled with a mixture of his screaming and crying and the dog yowling and moaning. The customer stumbles back into the bar: clothes torn and covered in blood, part of his ear missing. He scans the bar and says, " Alright! Where's the old hag with the bad tooth?!"

An old priest goes golfing one sunny afternoon with a young priest fresh out of seminar. The old priest carefully places his ball on the tee, concentrates, and strikes beautifully. However, the wind blows the ball off course and it falls into the rough. "That goddamn wind!" says the old priest. The young priest turns to him, horrified. "Sir, you shouldn't swear like this... Remember, God said unto Moses *Thou shalt not take the name of Lord thy God in vain.*" The old priest mumbles a half-hearted excuse and shuffles off to find his ball. He positions himself, checks his grip on the club, and strikes. The ball heads straight toward the hole... then gets blown off course again. "That GODDAMN wind!" yells the old priest. The young priest grows pale. "Sir," he pleads, "you really shouldn't swear like this." But the old priest is already walking toward the brush where his ball landed. He reaches it, and strikes it a third time. The ball gets blown off course yet again and lands right in the middle of a pond. "THAT GODDAMN WIND!!" screams the priest, throwing his club away in a fit. "Sir," the young priest begins, but then there is a mighty flash in the heavens, and the young priest is struck dead by lightning. The old priest falls to his knees. "God," he asks, "why did you smite this poor young man instead of me?" A booming voice echoes through the sky : "That goddamn wind..."

He arrives at the bar and, not long after arriving, he's talking to this gorgeous blonde and they're really hitting it off. Then she asks, "So what do you do for a living?" And he says "Well, I make a lot of money as a neuro-surgeon." "oh," she says and she can barely hide her disappointment.

They're really getting into it so they retire to the hotel across the street and make passionate love to one another until they're both exhausted. As they're lying there recovering, the neuro-surgeon starts giggling to himself. So, the brunette says, "What's so funny?" and he starts cackling harder and harder. "You best not be laughing at me!" she cries and he can only lie there gasping for breath he's laughing so hard. "WHAT THE HELL IS SO DAMN FUNNY?!" She screams and he's roaring with laughter, "I've only been a lawyer an hour and I've already fucked somebody!"

A shy wood eye'd man. A man takes a visit to the doctor to see what he can do about getting an artificial eye. He says to the doctor, "Doc I don't have much cash but can you give me an eye that looks as real as it gets for cheap?" The doctor responds, "I have a wood eye here for you and no one will be able to tell the difference." The man buys the eye and leaves the doctor's office. The man comes back a week later and says to the doctor, "Doc I don't think this eye helping me out, I'm just not having any luck with the ladies." The doctor then puts his hands on the man's shoulders and says, "It's not about the eye it's about confidence, go out there and just be confident about yourself." The man decides that going out to club would be the best way to get chicks so he goes and as usual is not confident within himself to pick up on any ladies. He then spots a woman with a bit of a hump back and he thinks to himself, "she has a bit of a deformity like me so she'll have to say yes!" So he walks over to her and he asks, "Miss would you like to dance with me?" and she responds with, "OH WOULD I!" He quickly replies with, "whatever you hump back bitch!"

"If I died and you remarried," the husband asks, "would he live in this house?" "We've spent a lot of money getting this house just the way we want it. I'm not going to get rid of my house. I guess he would." "If I died and you remarried, and he lived in this house," the husband asks, "would he sleep in our bed?" "Well, the bed is brand new, and it cost us $2000. It's going to last a long time, so I guess he would have to." "What about playing golf, would you play golf with him?" "I love golf, so sure, I would play golf with him." "Would he use my golf clubs?" "Oh, no!" the wife replies. "He's left-handed!"
The crying horse Guy sitting at a bar looks up to see a sign, "$1000 reward to any person who can stop my horse from crying". The guy calls the bartender over. "What's the story with the horse". "I've had him for years but recently i just can't stop him crying" says the bartender. "Many people tried cheering him up?" "Dozens, they've all failed, but you're welcome to try if you want" he says. With that the guy walks out the back, finds the horse and returns 30 seconds later. From the bar the bartender can hear the horse laughing. Raucous, uncontrollable laughter. The bartender is amazed, the guy collects his reward and leaves. A year later the guy finds himself back in the same bar and he spies a familiar sign. Only this time it reads "$1000 reward to any person who can stop my horse from laughing". The guy motions to the bartender again. "What's the story with the horse?" "He hasn't stopped laughing since you were here a year ago. I didn't think it was possible but it's even worse than the crying. If you can do anything about it that would be great" says the bartender. The guy nods. Once again he walks out back and returns about 30 seconds later. The bartender goes out to find his horse sobbing uncontrollably once more. He returns to the bar and says... "I can't believe it, that is truly amazing. Before i give you your reward do you mind if i ask what you did?" "It was quite simple" says the guy, "the first time i told the horse i had a bigger cock than him. The second time i showed him".

The time Newfoundland went to war with Quebec One time Newfoundland and Quebec went to war. A Newfie, being patriotic, signed up to fight and went into basic training. Now, Newfoundland was a poor province and the army didn't have enough guns so the guys was told to just pretend to have gun and shout "bang, bang". Eventually he finished training and his unit was deployed. He still didn't have a gun so when they went up against the Quebeckers he did the only thing he knew, he pretended he had a gun and went "Bang, bang." Amazingly, when he did this the Quebeckers he was aiming at would fall down. So he kept going "Bang, bang" and was very effective as a soldier. He was a good shot. Then, he looked up and saw a big Quebecker coming down the hill towards him. So he aimed and went "Bang, bang". The guy kept coming. "Bang, bang" - no effect. "Bang, bang" - no effect. Eventually the Qiuebecker ran right over him and continued down the hill going "Tankity, tankity, tankity".

A man stumbles across an old lamp..... A man was walking along a California beach and stumbled across an old lamp. He picked it up and rubbed it and out popped a genie. The genie said, "OK, You released me from the lamp, blah blah blah. This is the fourth time this month and I'm getting a little sick of these wishes so you can forget about three... You only get one wish!" The man sat, and thought about it for a while and said, "I've always wanted to go to Hawaii, but I'm scared to fly and I get very seasick. Could you build me a bridge to Hawaii so I can drive over there to visit?" The genie laughed and said, "That's impossible!!! Think of the logistics of that! How would the supports ever reach the bottom of the Pacific? Think of how much concrete, how much steel!! No, think of another wish." The man said "OK, I will try to think of a really good wish". Finally, he said, "I've been married and divorced four times. My wives always said that I don't care and that I'm insensitive. So, I wish that I could understand women, know how they feel inside and what they're thinking when they give me the silent treatment, know why they're crying, know what they really want when they say "nothing," know how to make them truly happy."

"That's awful, how does it feel to freeze to death?" says the first. "It's very uncomfortable at first, you get the shakes, and you get pains in all your fingers and toes. But eventually, it's a very calm way to go. You get numb and you kind of drift off, as if you're sleeping. How did you die?" says the second. "I had a heart attack", says the first guy. "You see, I knew my wife was cheating on me, so one day I showed up at home unexpectedly. I ran up to the bedroom, and found her alone, knitting. I ran down to the basement, but no one was hiding there. I ran up to the second floor, but no one was hiding there either. I ran as fast as I could to the attic, and just as I got there, I had a massive heart attack and died." " The second man shakes his head. "that's so ironic" he says. "What do you mean?" asks the first man "If you had only stopped to look in the freezer, we'd both still be alive."

Aunt Karen A teacher told her young class to ask their parents for a family story with a moral at the end of it, and to return the next day to tell their stories. In the classroom the next day, Joe gave his example first, "My dad is a farmer and we have chickens. One day we were taking lots of eggs to market in a basket on the front seat of the truck when we hit a big bump in the road; the basket fell off the seat and all the eggs broke. The moral of the story is not to put all your eggs in one basket.." "Very good," said the teacher. Next, Mary said, "We are farmers too. We had twenty eggs waiting to hatch, but when they did we only got ten chicks. The moral of this story is not to count your chickens before they're hatched.." "Very good," said the teacher again, very pleased with the response so far. Next it was Barney's turn to tell his story: "My dad told me this story about my Aunt Karen.... Aunt Karen was a flight engineer in the war and her plane got hit. She had to bail out over enemy territory and all she had was a bottle of whisky, a machine gun and a machete." "Go on," said the teacher, intrigued. "Aunt Karen drank the whisky on the way down to prepare herself; then she landed right in the middle of a hundred enemy soldiers. She killed seventy of them with the machine gun until she ran out of bullets. Then she killed twenty more with the machete till the blade broke. And then she killed the last ten with her bare hands." "Good heavens," said the horrified teacher, "What did your father say was the moral of that frightening story?" "Stay away from Aunt Karen when she's been drinking..."

"You must be an engineer," says the balloonist. "I am," replies the man. "How did you know?" "Well," says the balloonist, "everything you have told me is technically correct but your information is useless and the fact is I am still lost." The man below says, "You must be a manager" "I am," replies the balloonist, "but how did you know?" "Well," says the man below, "you don't know where you are or where you're going. You made a promise which you have no idea how to keep and you expect me to solve your problem. And the fact is you are in exactly the same position you were in before we met but now it's somehow my fault."

"I wish for a million bucks!" exclaimed the second man. With a puff of smoke, the genie disappeared and a million ducks began falling from the sky.

"The price of doing business at the Vet's office" A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, "I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away." The distressed woman wailed, "Are you sure?" "Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead," replied the vet.. "How can you be so sure?" she protested. "I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something." The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. The vet looked at the woman and said, "I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck." The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman. The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. "$150!" she cried, "$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!" The vet shrugged, "I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150."

Satan replies: "Hey, things are going great. We've got air conditioning, flush toilets, and escalators. And there's no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next." "What!" God exclaims: "You've got an engineer? That's a mistake - he should never have been sent to Hell. Send him to me." "Not a chance," Satan replies: "I like having an engineer on the staff, and I'm keeping him!" God insists: "Send him back or I'll sue." Satan laughs uproariously and answers: "Yeah, right.

What was Farmer Joe supposed to say? Farmer Joe decided his injuries from his recent accident were serious enough to take the trucking company, responsible for the accident, to court. In court, the trucking company's fancy lawyer was questioning Farmer Joe. "Didn't you say, at the scene of the accident, that you were fine?" ''Well, I'll tell you what happened. I had just loaded my favorite mule Bessie into the--" ''I didn't ask for any details,'' the lawyer interrupted. ''Just answer the question. Did you not say, at the scene of the accident, that you were fine?" ''Well I had just got Bessie into the trailer and was driving down the road--'' ''Judge, I am trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the Highway Patrolman on the scene that he was just fine. Now several weeks after the accident, he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question.'' By this time the Judge was fairly interested in Farmer Joe's answer and told the lawyer so. ''Well," said the farmer, "as I was saying, I had just loaded my favorite mule Bessie into the trailer and was driving her down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my truck right in the side. I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other. I was hurting real bad and didn't want to move. But could hear Bessie moaning and groaning and I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans. Shortly after the accident, a Highway Patrolman came on the scene. He could hear Bessie moaning and groaning so he went over to her. After he looked at her, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. Then the Patrolman came across the road with his gun in his hand and looked at me. He said, "Your mule was in such bad shape I had to shoot her. How are you feeling?"

A female elephant... ...is in a lot of pain, due to a thorn in her foot. An ant is walking by, and asks if he can be of assistance. She shows him her foot. The ant climbs onto her foot, and displaying his enormous relative strength, plucks the offending article out cleanly. The elephant, immediately relieved of pain, declares, "you have no idea how uncomfortable that was! I'm greatly in your debt. Is there anything I can do for you?" The ant blushes and says, "Believe it or not, I've always fantasized about making love to an elephant." The elephant laughs out loud. "But you're so tiny! You must be joking!" The ant, highly offended, starts to walk away. Feeling guilty now, the elephant says, "Actually, my fantasy has always been to make love with an ant. Please, have your way with me." The ant, visibly excited, runs up her leg and disappears entirely inside her. A monkey in a tree, who witnessed everything, starts to ridicule the elephant and hurl coconuts at her. One strikes the elephant in the head. "Ouch!" yells the elephant. A voice inside the elephant says, "Take it all, bitch!"

The Dogs Three dogs were sitting in the waiting room at the vet's, discussing why they were there. The first dog, a poodle, told his woeful tale. "My owners bought the great new sports car with leather seats. They took me for a ride in it one day, and I was so excited, I couldn't help myself. I wet all over the backseat. I'm here to be put down." The other two dogs nodded sympathetically, then the second, a Saint Bernard, explained his situation. "A brand new Persian rug had just been placed in the lounge room, and it was very expensive. My owners made a big fuss of it, when it came. Then, once when I was in the room, I had an incredible urge to roll all over it. So I did, and ended up getting quite a bit of my fur over the mat. My owners were very annoyed, and sent me here to be put to sleep." The other two dogs nodded, and the first dog asked the third, a German Shepard, what he was there for. "My owner has this habit of cleaning the house in the nude, and once when she was cleaning under the sofa, I just couldn't help myself. I jumped on and had the ride of my life." The other dogs tut-tutted. "So you're here to be put down too?" he asked. The Shepard shook his head. "No, just to get my nails clipped!" EDIT:: If you can't take a joke, then why are you here! If I knew something like this was actually true I would not post it, I am in school for a vet's assistant. Animal lover here, but I do have the brains to know it is just a joke, so chill the fuck out.

Upon their arrival, the captain showed the stewardess the best place for airline personnel to eat, shop and stay overnight. The next morning, as the pilot was preparing the crew for the day's route, he noticed the new stewardess was missing. He knew which room she was in at the hotel and called her up wondering what happened. She answered the phone, crying, and said she couldn't get out of her room. "You can't get out of your room?" the captain asked, "Why not?" The stewardess replied: "There are only three doors in here," she sobbed, "one is the bathroom, one is the closet, and one has a sign on it that says 'Do Not Disturb'!"

Three men, a philosopher, a mathematician and an idiot, were out riding in the car when it crashed into a tree. Before anyone knows it, the three men found themselves standing before the pearly gates of Heaven, where St. Peter and the Devil were standing nearby. "Gentlemen," the Devil started, "Due to the fact that Heaven is now overcrowded, St. Peter has agreed to limit the number of people entering Heaven. If anyone of you can ask me a question which I don't know or cannot answer,then you're worthy enough to go to Heaven; if not, then you'll come with me to Hell." The philosopher then stepped up,"OK, give me the most comprehensive report on Socrates' Socrates' teachings." With a snap of his finger, a stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. The philosopher read it and concluded it was correct. "Then, go to Hell!" With another snap of his finger, the philsopher disappeared. The mathematician then asked,"Give me the most complicated formula ever theorized!" With a snap of his finger, another stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. The mathematician read it and reluctantly agreed it was correct."Then, go to Hell!" With another snap of his finger, the mathematician disappeared too. The idiot then stepped forward and said, "Bring me a chair!" The Devil brought forward a chair. "Drill 7 holes on the seat." The Devil did just that. The idiot then sat on the chair and let out a very loud fart. Standing up, he asked, "Which hole did my fart come out from?" The Devil inspected the seat and said,"The third hole from the right.""Wrong," said the idiot, "it's from my asshole." And the idiot went to heaven.

The Czechoslovakian and the German A Czech and a German entered into a contest. The point of the contest was to guess the right 7 numbers and win an all expense paid trip to Alaska to hunt a grizzly bear. The contest ended and it turns out the two men guessed the same winning numbers, so both got to go on the hunt. After arriving in the camp and getting settled they decide to head out tomorrow with the guide to hunt the mighty bear. But the next day the guide is feeling under the weather so the two men decide to go out alone. After hiking through rugged mountains for hours they come into a clearing and see two bears, a male and a female. The German takes aim and pulls the trigger... "Click"! The all expense paid trip didn't come with ammo. The sound startled the bears and they charged. The Czech pulls his knife and rushes at the bears. The German tries to pull his pistol but stumbled backwards, hit his head, and fell into a river. When he comes to he sees the guide kneeling over him. After being briefed on the situation they decide to track the bears and save the Czech. They find the female bear chewing on a boot, the guide takes aim and... "Bang!", the bear is dead. The two men cut open the bear and her stomach is empty except for a few fish. The German utters the immortal words," The Czechs in the Male"

Three dudes die. One is a doctor, the other is a surgeon, and the last is an HMO. St. Peter greets them and explains they can't get into heaven just yet. They each need to do something first. St. Peter turns to the doctor, "You were a good doctor, but you didn't always make time for your patients, and some of them dies because of it. You must apologize to them all before you can enter." The doctor agrees and an angel takes him to the patients. Next, St. Peter speaks to the surgeon, "You were a great surgeon, but one day you were in a hurry and your patient died. That person must forgive you before you can go to heaven." The surgeon agrees and an angel comes to take him to the patient. Finally, St. Peter gets to the HMO, "You were a great HMO, so you can get into heaven with no hassle." "Really?" asks the HMO. "Yes, but you only qualify to stay for three days."
So a Biologist, Physicist, and Mathematician are asked to observe a phenomena. A Biologist, Physicist, and Mathematician are asked to observe a phenomena. The sit down in front of a door, they inspect the room on the other side and conclude that there is no exit other than the entrance. They then watch as one person enters the room, and then later, two persons exit. The Biologist, puzzled at first, concludes that the only rational conclusion is the person reproduced. The Physicist, first assuming there was no error in observation, states that there must be some new physics inside the room. The Mathematician in deep thought says, "I don't know, but if we have another person enter the room, it should be empty!"
A couple of jokes I've learned over the years. Extremely NSFW A man goes to the whorehouse looking for a cheap fuck. He walks in and says, "Gimme the cheapest whore you've got." The man at the desk asks for ten dollars and sends him to the end of the hall. The man arrives at the room and opens the door to see an already naked woman laying spread-eagle on the bed. "So... Should I just get started?" He asked. The woman said nothing, so he shrugged, unzipped his pants, and started going. About five minutes later, he finishes. Immediately upon finishing, semen starts gushing from her eyes, ears, and mouth. The man is horrified and runs screaming from the room before he even gets his pants on. The owner sees this display and goes to inspect the room. He sticks his head in the door, turns around, and yells, "Hey Jim! Dead one's full again!" A man walks into a bar, and notices a man sitting in a booth with a shoebox labeled: BRAZILLIAN BLOWJOB TOAD "What's in the box?" He asks. "This here is a Brazillian Blowjob Toad!" the man says "Ten bucks gets you the best blowjob you'll ever get." The man politely declines, and goes to get a drink. About an hour later, the man is feeling tipsy and decides one bj wouldn't hurt. He walks over to the man and slams ten dollars on the table. The man hands him the box and he walks into the bathroom. Ten minutes later, the man comes out of the bathroom and exclaims, "Wow! That was the best blowjob I've ever had! I'll give you $100 for it!" The man accepts the money and he walks out of the bar with the box under his arm, whistling a merry tune on his way home. He arrives at home and knocks at the door, which is opened by his wife. "Where the hell have you been?! And what the hell is that?!" She says. "Oh this? This is a Brazillian Blowjob Toad." "So?" "So teach it to cook and get the fuck out!" And one short one: What's the difference between a hooker and a drug dealer? A hooker can wash her crack and sell it again! I'll be here all week. And most likely for the rest of my life.

The third blond had seen how this worked out for the other two, so she also prayed to god saying, 'please god, give me the strength, ability, and intelligence to cross this river.' And Poof! God turned her into a man. He looked at the map, then walked upstream and across the bridge.

The Fish Princess and the Commoner Crab Once upon a time, in the undersea kingdom, there lived a fish princess. This fish princess had fallen in love with a peasant crab. When her father, the fish king, found out about their affair he forbade her to ever see him again. When she asked him why he replied "No daughter of mine will consort with a lowly sideways-walking crab!" Devastated, but with no other choice, the fish princess goes to her crab and delivers the news. "My father says we can't be together," she tells him, "he says you're a lowly side-walker, and that I'm forbidden to see you." The crab, crushed by the news, turns and sadly walks away - sidewise, of course. That night there was a gala ball at the fish palace. All the nobility of the undersea kingdom was there in attendance including, of course, the fish king and princess. Then, at the very height of festivities, the doors to the ballroom suddenly burst open... and there was the crab. The entire room burst into excited whispers, all the attendees having heard the rumor of the princess' affair with a side-walking commoner. To their surprise, however, before their very eyes, the crab took one step forward... then another step forward... and another... walking forward down the red carpet toward the king on his throne. As the crab approached the king the room went silent in anticipation. The crab looked the king square in the eye... opened his mouth... and slurred "I am soooooo super drunk right now."

So a man and women are sharing drinks at the bar...(kinda gross) ...when they decide to go the nearby hotel and hook up. They get into the room, turn off the lights and begin to have sex. The man puts on a condom and goes to put it in. But when he tries to insert it, the condom tears. Thinking it is just an old condom, he takes it off and figures she looks clean enough so he tries it without one. But when the man tries to insert his uncovered member into her "whoo-who-dilly" he still feels resistance. So he figures, maybe it's just a little dry. So he spits on his hand and rubs it on his dick thinking, "that will do the trick". But again, he finds it impossible to enter her. So after a few attempts of using spit as lube, he finally says to the woman, "I'm sorry but something is preventing me from getting the job done, do you have any ideas?" She calmly smiles and nods, gets up from the bed and goes into the bathroom. After a few minutes, she returns from the bathroom and tells him to try it this time. Confused and not sure what she did to make it better, he tires to enter her. This time, he glides right in. No resistance at all. In fact, he can't believe that it's the same girl, same vagina. It's moist and inviting. so he finishes the job and they are lying on the bed together sharing a smoke. After a few minutes of his mind racing to find an answer, he breaks down and asks the woman what she did in the bathroom that made her feel completely different and was able to let him finally penetrate her. Which she just replied, "Nothing really. I mean all I did was pick the scabs". (this is the 1st joke I've ever posted so be kind)

Various law enforcement agencies have a fugitive tracking competition. A forest is divided by high fences into 100-acre sections, a squirrel is released into each one, and the game begins. The CIA fill their section with animal agents all wearing wires. After three months with no leads, they announce that the squirrel never really existed. The FBI works for a month and gets no leads. They burn down the forest, positively ID the squirrel remains, and announce at a press conference that the manhunt was an unqualified success. Two hours after the competition begins, the LAPD leaves their section with a beaten, bloody, nearly-dead raccoon, along with a signed confession in the raccoon's handwriting admitting that it's a squirrel.

The Beethoven Mystery When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard. A couple days later,the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate. When the magistrate arrived,he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, "Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards." He listened a while longer, and said, "There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling." So the magistrate kept listening; "There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth..." Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, "My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing."

First-year students at Medical School were receiving their first anatomy class... with a real dead human body. They all gathered around the surgery table with the body covered with a white sheet. The professor started the class by telling them, "In medicine, it is necessary to have two important qualities as a doctor: the first is that you can not be disgusted by anything involving the human body". For an example, the professor pulled back the sheet, stuck his finger in the butt of the corpse, withdrew it and stuck it in his mouth. "Go ahead and do the same thing," he told his students. The students freaked out, hesitated for several minutes, but eventually took turns sticking a finger in the butt of the dead body and sucking on it. When everyone finished, the professor looked at them and told them, "The second most important quality is observation. I stuck in my middle finger and sucked on my index finger. Now learn to pay attention.

A woman walked into a bank, A woman walked into a bank in New York and asked for the loan officer. She said that she was going to Europe on business for two weeks and needed to borrow $5000. The bank officer told her that he will need some kind of security for such loan. So the woman handed over the keys of a new Rolls Royce car that was parked on the street in front of the bank. Everything was checked and the bank agreed to accept the car as security for the loan. An employee rode the car into the bank's underground garage and parked it there. Two weeks later, the woman came back, repaid the $5000 with interest of $15. The loan officer came to her and said, "We are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked very well. But we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked out your accounts and found that you were a multimillionaire. What puzzled us was why should you bother to borrow $5000?" The woman replied, "Well, where else in Manhattan, can I park my car for two weeks for $15?"
Bull Fighting &gt;A young man stopped at a local restaurant after a day of roaming around in Mexico. &gt;While sipping his tequila, he noticed a sizzling, scrumptious-looking platter being served at the next table. &gt;It looked good. &gt;It smelled good. &gt;He asked the waiter, "What is that you just served?" &gt;The waiter replied, "Ah senor, you have excellent taste! Those are bull's testicles from the bull fight this morning. A delicacy!" &gt;The visitor, though momentarily daunted, said, "What the heck, I'm on holiday down here! Bring me an order!" &gt;The waiter replied, "I am so sorry senor. There is only one serving per day because there is only one bull fight each morning. If you come early tomorrow and place your order, we will be sure to save you this delicacy!" &gt;The next morning, the man returned, placed his order, and then that evening was served the one and only special delicacy of the day. &gt;After a few bites, and inspecting the contents of his platter, he called to the waiter and said, "These are delicious, but they are much, much smaller than the ones I saw you serve yesterday!" &gt;The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, "Si, senor. Sometimes the bull wins."

He told me he was gay, thought you were cute, and asked me if we had any Vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey. I love you too!!"
A man walks into a pub.. And pauses. It's a really crappy place full of smoke and wood and the kind of men who look like they last moved during the second world war. He walks up to the bar, and orders a pint. As he's drinking, he looks round and spots a huge jar behind the bar, with something long and pale and sausage-like inside. "What's that?", he asks, pointing to it. "That", replies the barman, "is a pickled penis, sir. It's magic. You say 'pickled penis', then whatever you want, and it fetches it. Watch, sir. Pickled penis; packet of peanuts". Immediately the penis leaps from the jar, rockets over to the peanuts, grabs a bag in its bellend, and pops them over to the barman before heading back into the jar. The man stares in wonder, but shakes his head in disbelief soon after. "No, no, that's a trick. You've got some kind of strings in there, mate- something making it move, yeah? Got to be" "No, sir", replies the barman. "I'll do it again. Pickled penis; get me a fiver". Once again, the penis rockets out of the jar, goes to the till, opens it, pulls out the money, drops it by the barman, and heads back to the jar. At this, the man drains his glass, and shakes his head. "No", he says, "no, I'm not standing for this. I don't know what's going on, but it's fucking crazy, and I'm not standing for it. I'm going. Fuck this. I'm off to Starbucks". He stands, walks a few steps, and laughs to himself. As he reaches the door, he glances back, and mutters. "Pickled penis, my arse".

He walks down to his ball, hits it out of the pond and into the hole. Next up, Jesus. He walks out onto the water and his ball floats up to the surface, so he hits his ball off of the water into the hole. The old man decides he will try something cool so he walks into the water and hits his ball, which flies out of the water, hits a bird, bounces off a tree, then gets deflected off the pin and hits a rabbit then bounces into the hole.

I'm sorry, but it doesn't look to me like you know a thing about criminology or history, which are critical to this line of work. You didn't even spell FBI correctly! I mean, can you even tell me who killed Abraham Lincoln?" Bubba thought for a moment, then shook his head. The agent continued, "All right do this. Go home, study, and if you come back up here and can tell me who killed Abraham Lincoln, I'll let you take the test again." Bubba agreed and took his return flight home. When his friends asked, "How'd the FBI test go?" Bubba said "It went great! I've only been with the agency 12 hours and they've already got me on a murder case!"

Darn kinds The kids filed back into class Monday morning. They were very excited. Their weekend assignment was to sell something, then give a talk on productive salesmanship.Little Sally led off: "I sold girl scout cookies and I made $30," she said proudly, "My sales approach was to appeal to the customer's civil spirit and I credit that approach for my obvious success.""Very good," said the teacher. Little Jenny was next: "I sold magazines," she said, "I made $45 and I explained to everyone that magazines would keep them up on current events." "Very good, Jenny," said the teacher. Eventually, it was Little Johnny's turn. The teacher held her breath. Little Johnny walked to the front of the classroom and dumped a box full of cash on the teacher's desk. "$2,467," he said. "$2,467!" cried the teacher, "What in the world were you selling?" "Toothbrushes," said Little Johnny. "Toothbrushes," echoed the teacher, "How could you possibly sell enough tooth brushes to make that much money?" "I found the busiest corner in town," said Little Johnny, "I set up a Dip &amp; Chip stand. I gave everybody who walked by a sample. They all said the same thing, "Hey, this tastes like shit!" Then I would say, "It is shit. Wanna buy a toothbrush?"

A Soviet Russian food collector and a farmer A Soviet official in charge of collecting food from farms goes to a local farm and is greatly warmly by the farmer. After some light hearted conversation, the official says, "Anyways, I am here to collect the potatoes you have grown." The farmer replies, "Oh, yes. This has been a marvelous year. We have grown so many potatoes, that if we put them all into a pile, it would reach the foot of God." The official replies, "That is ridiculous. You know that in Soviet Russia, there is no God." The farmer responds, "That is fine. We have no potatoes either."

A 55 year old woman had a heart attack and was taken to the hospital... While on the operating table she had a near death experience. Seeing God, she asked "Is my time up?" God said, "No, you have another 43 years, 2 months and 8 days to live." Upon recovery, the woman decided to stay in the hospital and have a face-lift, liposuction, breast implants and a tummy tuck. She even had someone come in and change her hair colour and brighten her teeth! Since she had so much more time to live, she figured she might as well make the most of it. After her last operation, she was released from the hospital. While crossing the street on her way home, she was killed by an ambulance. Arriving in front of God, she demanded, "I thought you said I had another 43 years? Why didn't you pull me from out of the path of the ambulance?" God replied: "I didn't bloody recognise you!"

So one of the programmers for Aliens:Colonial Marines passes away... And he's at the pearly gates. St. Peter's walks up to him and says, "Hey, so God's been implementing this new thing where he's giving people a choice between heaven and hell. You can take a peek at both but have to make a choice and will be there for all eternity." So, the program takes a peek into heaven. Rather boring, kinda like a nice little suburb with angels and such, but nothing too intriguing. Afterwards, the programmer goes and checks out hell and his mind is blown, it's pretty much a fiesta, and a complete orgy all in one. The programmer says, "Hell, hell. I choose hell," and thus goes to hell. About three months later, St. Peters went to check on the programmer. He found the programmer covered in feces, which was on fire, screaming in torment and rage, as tiny devils came with pitch forks to mutilate his testes. "What's the deal Peter," the programmer said. "Everything was like a beautiful, sexy party and now hell is terrible." St Peter replied, "Yeah, that was just the demo."

Sign language Two deaf people got married. During the first week of marriage, they found they were unable to communicate in the bedroom when they turn the lights off because they can't see each other using sign language. After several nights of fumbling around and misunderstandings, the wife decides to find a solution. "Honey," she signs, "Why don't we agree on some simple signals? For instance, at night, if you want to have sex with me, reach over and squeeze my right breast one time. If you don't want to have sex, reach over and squeeze my left breast one time." The husband thinks this is a great idea and signs back to his wife, "Great idea, now if you want to have sex with me, reach over and pull on penis one time." "If you don't want to have sex, reach over and pull on my penis....fifty times."

I'll buy the damn ball if you shut up. How much? " 300 dollars" No way I'm paying that much! " I'm gonna tell" Fine, ya rip off! Here. They swap the money and the ball. A few days later the strange guy is back at it and Johnny's dad comes home early again and the guy hides in the closet again. The following conversation occurs: "It's dark in here huh?" Yeah. Shut up. " wanna buy a baseball glove?" No. Not this time. "I'll tell daddy" Fine. How much? " 700 dollars" No way! "Yes or I'm gonna scream" Needless to say, they swap cash for glove.

Johnny explains he sold them for $1000. Infuriated, his dad brings him to church to confess. He puts Johnny in the booth and the following conversation occurs: " it's dark in here huh?" Don't start that shit again you little rip off!

A guy thought his wife was cheating on him. So he waited for her to leave that night and jumped into a cab to follow her. By following her he found she was working in a whorehouse. The guy says to the cabbie, "wanna make $100?" The cabbie says, "sure, what do I have to do?" The guy replied that all the cabbie has to do is going inside the whorehouse and grab his wife and put her in the back of the cab and take them home. So the cabbie goes in. A couple minutes later the whore house gets kicked open, and the cabbie is dragging this woman out who is kicking, biting, punching, and fighting all the way to the cab.

Fun with police Recently a routine police patrol parked outside a local pub. Late in the evening the officer noticed a man leaving the bar so intoxicated that he could barely walk. The man stumbled around the car park for a few minutes, with the officer quietly observing. After what seemed an eternity and trying his keys on five vehicles, the man managed to find his car which he fell into. He sat there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off. Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off (it was a fine dry night) flicked the indicators on, then off, tooted the horn and then switched on the lights. He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little and then remained stationery for a few more minutes as some more vehicles left. At last he pulled out of the car park and started to drive slowly down the road. The police officer, having patiently waited all this time, now started up the patrol car, put on the flashing lights, promptly pulled the man over and carried out a breathalyser test. To his amazement, the breathalyser indicated no evidence of the man having consumed alcohol at all! Dumbfounded, the officer said "I'll have to ask you to accompany me to the police station. This breathalyser equipment must be broken." "I doubt it", said the man, "tonight I'm the designated decoy."

Why is it hard to sell bibles in Germany? Because it's a Nietzsche Market.
Irish dirt farmers There was a poor dirt farming family in Ireland. All they had was this one milk cow. The would turn the milk to cheese and sell at the market to buy food. Well, one morning, the father wakes up and sees the milk cow dead. So he hangs himself in the tree. The mother wakes up, sees the milk cow dead and her husband hanging from the tree and throws herself into the river and she washes up on the shore. The oldest son wakes up, sees the milk cow dead, his father hanged and, by his mother who has washed up on the shore, a leprechaun - a female leprechaun. She says " Looks like you're having a bad day". he say "I should say so." She says "i'll make you a deal, if you make love to me 10 times in a row, I'll bring your mom and dad back, and even the milk cow". He says "why not?". He almost makes it but fails, so she kills him. The next son wakes up, sees the milk cow dead, his father hanging and his mother and brother dead by the shore near the leprechaun. She tells him "if you make love to me 10 times in a row, I'll bring you father, mother and brother back, and also the milk cow". He agrees. He doesn't make it either, so the leprechaun kills him. The youngest son wakes up, sees the milk cow dead, the father hanging from the tree, and his mother and two brothers dead by the shore, and the female leprechaun. She tells him "if you make love to me 10 times in a row, without stopping, I'll bring your father, mother and two brothers back, and even the milk cow". He says "Well, look at you and look at me, I'm young and virile, let's try it. BUT, what if I make love to you 15 times in a row?" She says, "In that case, I'll bring your father, mother and brothers back, even the milk cow and give you nice mansion where your hovel is". He says "That's fine and all, but what if I make love to you 20 times in a row?" She says "If you make love to me 20 times in a row, I'll bring your entire family back, even the milk cow, give you mansion where your hovel is and give you a big pot of gold that will last you your entire life". He says "alright let's get started in a minute, but first, if I make love to you 20 times in a row, what's to stop YOU from dying? The milk cow did."

"Go to the back and give me everything you've got!" the man says. The woman replies, "Sir, this is a SPERM bank." "I don't give a shit, you go get me what I told you!"

"Open one of those samples!" The woman takes the lid off a sample. "DRINK ONE!" "Excuse me? You want me to drink it? That's disgusting." "Bitch, I WILL FUCKING SHOOT YOU! Drink it now!" The woman, frightened, picks up the sample and drinks it down. The man then removes his ski mask, revealing that he is the husband of the woman working the desk. He looks his wife straight in the eyes and says, "It's not that fucking hard, now is it?"

A fav from Austin Powers Hope a movie script is okay for this subreddit: Dr. Evil and Austin Powers are hurriedly climbing up a ladder, when Austin falls, grabbing onto Dr Evil's pants on the way down, thus dropping his pants a certain amount: Austin *in his heavily accented voice* : "You know, Dr. Evil... I always thought you were insane". Dr. Evil *looks back down at Austin*: "I know" Austin: "But now I just see your (you're) nuts." This has been one of my favorites for a long time. Hope it humors you too, either by recalling it, or simply shedding light on it. Ah thank you!

3 kinds of married sex: Before I got married, my grandpa pulled me aside and asked me if I knew everything I needed to know about sex. I told him I did, but he proceeded to educate me on the 3 kinds of sex I could expect now that I was going to have a wife. "For the first 6 months to a year, you're going to be having 'Anywhere' sex," he told me. "That's where you'll do it in the kitchen, in the car, on the couch... anywhere." "After that, there's a long period of 'Bedroom' sex. That's where you do it two or three times a month. Always in the bedroom, usually with the lights off. Finally, " he said, "comes 'Hallway' sex." "What's that, Pappy?" I said. "That's where you pass each other in the hall and say, 'Fuck you'."

However he suggested an alternative: He would inscribe, "Here lies a man who was both honest and a lawyer. That way, whenever anyone walked by the tombstone and read it, they would be certain to remark: "That's Strange!"

Beans and Mariage One day I met a sweet woman and fell in love. When it became apparent that we would marry, I made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans. Some months later, on my birthday, my car broke down on the way home from work. Since I lived in the countryside I called my wife and told her that I would be late because I had to walk home. On my way, I passed by a small diner and the odour of baked beans was more than I could stand. With miles to walk, I figured that I would walk off any ill effects by the time I reached home, so I stopped at the diner and before I knew it, I had consumed three large orders of baked beans. All the way home, I made sure that I released all the gas. Upon my arrival, my wife seemed excited to see! me and exclaimed delightedly: "Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight." She then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a seat and just as she was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. She made me promise not to touch the blindfold until she returned and went to answer the call. The baked beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming most unbearable, so while my wife was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a pulpwood mill. I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other cheek, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable. When eventually the telephone farewells signalled the end of my freedom, I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my wife returned, apologizing for taking so long. She asked me if I had peeked through the blindfold, and I assured her I had not. At this point, she removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table chorused: "Happy Birthday!"

Honey,is the cat at home?? A man absolutely hated his wife's cat and decided to get rid of him one day by driving him 20 blocks from his home and leaving him at the park. As he was getting home, the cat was walking up the driveway. The next day he decided to drive the cat 40 blocks away. He put the beast out and headed home. Driving back up his driveway, there was the cat! He kept taking the cat further and further and the cat would always beat him home. At last he decided to drive a few miles away, turn right, then left, past the bridge, then right again and another right until he reached what he thought was a safe distance from his home and left the cat there. Hours later the man calls home to his wife: "Jen, is the cat there?" "Yes", the wife answers, "why do you ask?" Frustrated, the man answered, "Put that cat on the phone, I'm lost and need directions!"
I know all about it. One day little timmy overheard a conversation on the bus where a man was telling his friend how he would get his wife to tell him whatever he wanted by saying "i know all about it" Taking the knowledge of these words little timmy went home and was greeted by his mother, to which he said "i know all about it" shocked the mother said "i didn't want you to find out about that so heres $20 if you don't tell your father". So little timmy went up to his father and after his father greeted him little timmy said "i know all about it", his father was confused for a minute and then quietly said "don't tell your mother about this" and gave him $40. Rather proud of himself timmy walked out the door to spend his money, Upon leaving the house timmy saw the mailman and thought he would try his luck one last time, So he looked the mailman dead in the eyes and said "i know all about it".Immediatly the mailman said "hello son".

North Dakota Farmer Vacations in New York A farmer who had lived in North Dakota all his life finally reached retirement age and decided to take his first vacation ever. Being frugal, as most farmers are, he had quite a hefty nest egg saved up from all those unmarried years toiling away alone in the middle of nowhere. To fight the boredom of retirement he decides to take a vacation in the most unlike North Dakota place he can think of...New York City. His first two weeks he spends his time doing everything tourists are supposed to do in New York. He visits the Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty. He tours the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the USS Intrepid. He even scores seats to Letterman and takes a few strolls through Central Park. With another week left of his vacation he has checked many things off his list, but still doesn't feel that he has seen the New York that New Yorkers experience every day. Deciding he probably won't find what he's looking for in the tourism brochures he heads down the the hotel bar and hits up the bartender for some information. After discussing what the North Dakota farmer is looking for the bartender points down the bar to a man sitting alone in a rumpled suit with a three day beard nursing a whiskey with a soured expression. The bartender tells the farmer if he wants experience New York like New Yorkers do that is the man to talk to. So the farmer orders a bottle of whatever the scruffy businessman is drinking and goes to introduce himself. After they drink and speak for awhile the farmer tells the scruffy guy what the bartender said and asks what the best kept secret of New York City is and if he would show it to him. The businessman thinks for a moment while tossing back the last of his drink before standing up abruptly and telling the farmer to follow him. They go outside the hotel, hail a cab, and within a few minutes they are at the Empire State Building. While they ride the elevator up alone the New Yorker explains to the wide eyed farmer that since the City was built on the coast on windy days, like today, the close proximity of the skyscrapers downtown create tremendous updrafts, and if you step off the edge of a tall building the updrafts will toss your right back up to the roof. The farmer expresses his disbelief as they step off the elevator to the empty roof. Shrugging out of his wrinkled suit coat, the New Yorker tosses it to the farmer and promptly declares he is willing to prove it. Before the farmer can stop him the New Yorker has scrambled over the fence and after one final grin at the farmer he leaps spread eagle from the roof. The farmer drops the coat and runs to the edge of the building and sure enough...the New Yorker comes whooshing up from below, up over the fence and sprawls next to his coat, laughing. Not to be outdone and excited to experience the real New York for himself, the farmer scrambles over the fence and with a final grin to the New Yorker, still laughing on his ass on the roof, leaps and screams with glee. Unfortunately, for the farmer, his screams of glee soon turn to terror as he plummets flailing his arms and legs until he reaches the pavement. SPLAT! About an hour later, the rumpled New York businessman walks back into the hotel bar and finds his previous quiet seat in the corner. The bartender sees him come in and comes over with a clean glass and a fresh bottle of whiskey. Setting them down on the table the bartender scowls at the scruffy New Yorker and his rumpled suit and mutters, "Superman, you sure are a mean drunk."
A pirate walks into a bar. The bartender looks up and sees the pirate walking in with a big, bus-sized steering wheel protruding from his fly. He says, "Hey, Captain, what's with the steering wheel sticking out of your crotch?" The pirate replies, "Arrrr, it's drivin' me nuts."

A Man in Vegas A man takes a trip to Vegas. After a night of gambling he loses all of his money. Broke and penniless, he tries desperately to find a cab to the airport, so he can get home with the little money he has left. The man gets in a cab outside the casino and says to the driver "I don't have any money left, could you please just give me a simple ride to the airport?" "screw you!" says the cab driver as he motions the man out of his car. A few years pass, the same man comes back out to Vegas and wins it big. He walks out of the casino to get a cab, and what does he see? The very same cab driver from a few years back at the end of a long line of taxis. The man decides its time for his revenge. He walks up to the first cab and says "How much to the airport?" "Fifteen bucks" says the first driver, "And how much for you to jerk me off when we get there?" The cab driver tells him to get away. The man walks down the line of cabs doing the exact same thing to each of them. He gets to the last cab, the driver that had made him walk all the way to the airport a few years back. "How much for a ride to the airport?" He asks calmly. The cab driver obviously doesn't remember him and responds normally "Fifteen dollars" "Ok" says the man, and he gets in the cab. The cab pulls away from the curb slowly, and as the man drives by all the other cab drivers he gives them a thumbs up and a big smile.

Mahatma Gandhi as you know, walked barefoot most of the time, which produced an impressive set of calluses on his feet. He also ate very little, which made him rather frail and with his odd diet, he suffered from bad breath. This made him ..(Oh, man, this is so bad, it's good).....

Help me? Alright, this one isn't a joke, but this is one of my favorite boards to lurk, and I need help. I'm giving a wedding speech tomorrow. I'm the groom. I really only have enough space in the speech for one joke. I want to insert it early in the speech, and have it be a great ice breaker. Nothing overly offensive, just something to get things going. If you come up with something I can use, I might be inclined to reward the best one with gold. (I've browsed for hours and can't think of a thing) If nothing else, you'll get a heck of a lot of karma with a great joke). Help me, fellow Redditors! Edit: formatting and rewording

Witch Doctor (If this joke offends you, I'm sorry. There's the door.) So this guy walks into a bar and orders two beers. He downs one and empties the other into his pocket. He orders a second round and does the same thing. After a couple more rounds of this the bartender gets kinda worried and says to the man "You know, it's your money and your beer, so who am I to say what you can and can't do with it... I'd just hate to think you're making a mess I'll have to clean up." The man looks at him and says "Not to worry, I have an eight inch man In my pocket drinking all those beers." Incredulous, the bartender say that's impossible. So the man reaches in his pocket and pulls out an eight inch tall man who he sets on the bar. He walks around a bit and the bartender hands him another beer which he begins to drink. Turning back to the regular sized man, the bartender asks "does he talk?" The man laughs and says "Sure he talks! Hey, Kevin, tell him about the time you called that witch doctor a stupid nigger."
The Pianist So this guy, let's call him John, comes to a bar after work. He is tired and not very happy with his life. He buys himself a beer and tries to forget about his worries, but this total drunk sitting next to him is constantly giggling annoyingly. John tries to ignore him, but at one point the drunk stands up and comes over to John. He thinks: "Oh great, now I have to deal with this guy" The drunk giggles, and says: -Dude... You wanna see something cool? John thinks: "I should just say yes so he will leave me alone sooner", and so says yes. The drunk then pulls out a miniature piano from his left pocket and sets it on the bar. He then puts his hand in his right pocket and pulls out a small man, fully dressed up and alive, that fits in his palm, and sets him on the bar. The small man looks at the two, dusts off his jacket, pulls out a tiny chair, and proceeds to play a beautiful piece on the piano. "Holy fucking shit, this is amazing, where the hell did you get this!?" said John. "There's a homeless guy in the alley behind this bar that grants any wish for just $20" said the drunk. John throws down a ten for his drink, and runs out of the bar into the alley behind it. He quickly finds the homeless man, digging through some trash, and says: -they say you grant wishes for twenty bucks The homeless guy just nods -alright, here's a twenty, I want to have a million bucks The homeless guy nods again and starts walking away. At this point a duck fell on John's head. Then another in the street. Then more ducks just started falling from the sky. John, pissed, catches up with the homeless guy and asks him what happened. The homeless guy just avoids eye contact and walks further away from him. John rushes back to the bar and finds the drunk. "What the hell just happened? I found the homeless guy, gave him a twenty, asked for a million bucks, then it just started raining ducks, and now he doesn't even want to talk to me. What is happening?" Said John. The drunk giggles to himself and says: "What, you think I asked him for a twelve inch pianist?"

"Have a good day, sir" He got his brand new Corvette convertible out of the dealership. Taking off down the road, he floored it to 80 mph, enjoying the wind blowing through what little hair he had left. "Amazing," he thought as he flew down I-75, pushing the pedal even more. Looking in his rear view mirror, he saw the highway patrol behind him, blue lights flashing and siren blaring. He floored it to 100mph, then 110, then 120. Suddenly he thought, "What am I doing? I'm too old for this," and pulled over to await the Trooper's arrival. Pulling in behind him, the Trooper walked up to the Corvette, looked at his watch and said, "Sir, my shift ends in 30 minutes. Today is Friday. If you can give me a reason for speeding that I've never heard before, I'll let you go." The old gentleman paused. Then said, "Years ago, my wife ran off with a Florida State Trooper. I thought you were bringing her back." "Have a good day, Sir," replied the Trooper

A dip and chip stand The kids filed back into class Monday morning. They were very excited. Their weekend assignment was to sell something, then give a talk on productive salesmanship. Little Sally led off: "I sold girl scout cookies and I made $30," she said proudly, "My sales approach was to appeal to the customer's civil spirit and I credit that approach for my obvious success." "Very good," said the teacher. Little Jenny was next: "I sold magazines," she said, "I made $45 and I explained to everyone that magazines would keep them up on current events." "Very good, Jenny," said the teacher.. Eventually, it was Little Johnny's turn. The teacher held her breath ... Little Johnny walked to the front of the classroom and dumped a box full of cash on the teacher's desk. "$2,467," he said. "$2,467!" cried the teacher, "What in the world were you selling?" "Toothbrushes," said Little Johnny. "Toothbrushes!" echoed the teacher, "How could you possibly sell enough tooth brushes to make that much money?" "I found the busiest corner in town," said Little Johnny, "I set up a Dip &amp; Chip stand and gave everybody who walked by a free sample." They all said the same thing, "Hey, this tastes like shit!" Then I would say, "It is shit. Wanna buy a toothbrush?" "I used the governmental approach of giving you something shitty for free, and then making you pay to get the shitty taste out of your mouth."
