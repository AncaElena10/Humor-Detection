I have provided a solution for humor detection in binary data.

Features extracted:
-> remove word with length less than 3
-> text cleaning (bring the words to their 'complete' form; that means removing the words with aportrofe (like haven't, it will become have not)
-> stop word (but just a few of them, I don't want to extract all the stop words because some of them can give the text a negative sentiment like 'not' or 'no' and if I remove them, then the sentence will automatically become a positive one, which is wrong.
-> punctuation
-> stem words
-> lemm words
-> n-grams (2, 3 words)

Algorithms used:
-> Logistic Regression
-> Naive Bayes (Bernoulli, Multinomial)
-> SVM (LinearSVC, SVC (with kernel = linear or rbf), NuSVC (with kernel = linear or rbf))
-> DecisionTree
-> RandonForest
-> KNeighbors

The best values of C (LogisticRegression), random_state (DecisionTree, RrandomForest), nu (NuSVC), n_neighbors (KNeighbors) were chosen with GridSearchCV.
